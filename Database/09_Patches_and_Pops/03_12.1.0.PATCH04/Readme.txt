  Energy Components - Read Me File of 12.1.0.PATCH04
=====================================================================
A. Pre-check functionality will do the following:
	1. Check that the database installation is based on the correct version i.e. 12.1.0.PATCH03. Installation shall not be continued if wrong   version 
	   detected. The check output will be shown in the first line of the report.
	2. Check if the service pack is already loaded into the database. Multiple installations of the same service pack in the same database is not encouraged. The check output will be shown in the second line of the report.
	3. If any of the steps above failed, the following lines in the report may be ignored.
	4. Check if individual objects to be installed is in proper state – meaning the objects are not changed by project-specific requirements. If it is not the case, the object will 
	   be listed in the pre-check report. The individual object being updated by customer-specific changes will be listed starting in line 8.
	5. If an object is listed in the report, take proper action; backing up the objects and reapply the changes after service pack is installed.
	6. Note: It is advised to run the pre-check once. If the identified error is found and fixed, executing the pre-check script again will still cause the object to be listed.
	   This is due to the value of the calculated md5 of the fixed object, will no longer be the same as the originally installed object.
	7. The pre-check generates a report of unintended behaviour of objects, that will be affected by the service pack. The report is in csv format (12.1.0.PATCH04_precheck_result.csv), which 
	   can be viewed by Microsoft Excel.
	8. The pre-check functionality depends on BLOB content. Visit each precheck.sql file for more information on comparing the content of object in the database against the expected 
	   value.
	9. If the database schema has previously imported using Oracle Data Pump, one central trigger named DDL_ECKERNEL may not be imported. This trigger is especially important for 
	   Precheck functionality. Make sure the trigger is available after import is performed.

B. To run the pre-check, do the following:
	1. Make the "..\ec-db-upgrade-12.1.0.PATCH04\12.1.0.PATCH04" the current folder, and start the SQL*Plus command
	2. Connect using the eckernel_<operation_name> user and run precheck.sql
	3. Review the report generated by the pre-check script.

C. Main Database Upgrade:
	To run the upgrade please follow below mentioned steps: 
	1. Make the "..\ec-db-upgrade-12.1.0.PATCH04\12.1.0.PATCH04" the current folder, and start the SQL*Plus command
	2. Run the following command: SQL>start install-patch.sql
	3. Enter the required parameters to connect to target database ECKERNEL schema.
