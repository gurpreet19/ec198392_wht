  DESCRIPTION: |-
    Calculates daily theoretical gas lift volume rate as:
    For DEFERMENT_VERSION = PD.0001 the theoretical rate is found as Daily Potential volume rate minus Total Deferred daily volume (regardless of well active status).
    For DEFERMENT_VERSION = PD.0001.01 the theoretical rate is found as Daily Potential volume rate adjusted for number of hours the well active status is OPEN and then subtract the Total Daily deferred volume.
    For DEFERMENT_VERSION = PD.0020 the theoretical rate is found as  Daily Potential volume rate( or adjusted for number of hours the well active status is OPEN) minus Total Deferred daily volume.
    Note that only parts of deferments with well active status OPEN is included within the calculation of daily deferred volume.
