  DESCRIPTION: '<p style="font-size: 10pt;">    <em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">        Transactional
    Inventory module in EC Revenue allows complex        inventory valuations using
    the EC calculation engine. It is a standard        calculation where minimal calculation
    knowledge is required and can be        fully configured through creating EC objects
    and configuration. It has        been designed with the intention of creating
    templates with standard        functionality. And for the cases that do not conform
    to the normal        rules, overrides can be created to cater for the exceptions.    </em></p><p

    Product Stream Setup</u>    also allows choosing the Product Group that should
    be used to auto generate    the products to be processed.<br>    The possible
    Layouts the inventory should provide are sat by choosing a    Transaction Inventory
