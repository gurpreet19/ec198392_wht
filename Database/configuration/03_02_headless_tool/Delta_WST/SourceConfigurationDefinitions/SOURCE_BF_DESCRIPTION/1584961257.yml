  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This screen is used to create plain text templates. EC does not
    apply any business logic based on the content and neither does the receiving side.
    This means that messages created from these templates are to be considered as
    textual information. Ex: The notification to a party that a pig is sent through
    a pipe.</p><p>The templates can contain any valid text character, and the meaning
    of the text/characters is to be decided by the users of EC. For instance a company
    could use XX⁄XX–XX as a placeholder for a date, and another would use DD⁄MM–YY.</p><p>These
    templates will be available in the “Send Freetext Message” screen. In this screen
    you will be able to edit the message according to your specific needs, adding
    dates, values and so on.</p>'
