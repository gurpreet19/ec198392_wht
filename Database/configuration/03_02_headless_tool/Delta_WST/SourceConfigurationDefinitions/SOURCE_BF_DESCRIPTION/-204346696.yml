  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This screen is used to monitor the confirmation of a trade between
    a seller and a buyer. There are typically two products that can be traded: pipeline
    gas (stock&nbsp;account) or sales gas.</p><p>The seller and the buyer must send
    a message with the same information (delivery point, date, hour, quantity) to
    confirm the trade. When the trade is confirmed by&nbsp;the seller and the buyer,
    the gas will be swapped at the requested time for the trade. This quanity will
    later be used to calculate the actually delivered quantities.</p><p>There is no
    connection between trading requests and confirmation. There can be several buyers
    for one trading request or two shippers can agree a trade (and just&nbsp;send
    the trading conformation messages) without a trading request.</p><p>All confirmation
    messages are shown here. If a confirmation is received by for instance a message
    handling system, the message processing function will try to&nbsp;match it to
    an existing confirmation. If a confirmation does not exist, it will end up as
    a new line in this screen. If there is a match, the trading summary will be sent</p>'
