  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function enables users to store hydrocarbon liftings/cargos by company/contract and product. EC Sales implementations, in particular Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs), will often need to store cargo files received from partners that will be used as input when calculating the PSA or verifying that the terms of the PSA have been fulfilled. In these cases projects often deem the terminal operation module of EC Transport, even the BLMR Light business function, to be to extensive. This makes the Period Contract Lifting BF the preferred choice for PSA implementations.</p><p>The business function supports multiple cargos per day because of sequence numbering in the primary key.</p>
