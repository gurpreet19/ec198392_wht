  DESCRIPTION: <p>Large systems may have comprehensive reports that consist of a huge portion of report items. In this context, a report item is a report that can be processed by the reporting engine, e.g. Business Objects. If the amount of report items is high, and if some of the report items take long time to generate, the system may have many reports in a queue waiting to be processed. In such a case, it is useful to have a mechanism to monitor the queue status.</p><p>The Report Queue Status business function shows the status of reports that are waiting to be processed, but also reports that are already generated (status = GENERATED). The fields in the navigator will filter the rows in the Report Queue Status section. The Report Queue Status section consists of the following fields:</p><ul><li>- Runable Report Name – This is the name of the report. This can be found in the Report Administration business function.</li><li>- Status – An ordered report can have one of these statuses:</li><li class="ql-indent-1">NEW – Report is ordered and are waiting to be processed, or report is ordered and being processed.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">ERROR – Generation of report has failed.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">GENERATED – Generation of report is done and it is ready for further actions.</li><li>- Generation Start – This is when the generation of the report started.</li><li>- Generation End – This is when the generation of the report ended.</li><li>- New – Shows how many report items that do <em>not </em>have status GENERATED or ERROR. This is aggregated from the section below.</li><li>- Generated – shows how many report items that have status GENERATED. This is aggregated from the section below.</li><li>- Printed Date – If the report has been printed one or more times, the last printed date is shown here.</li><li>- Sent Date – If the report has been distributed one or more times, the last distribution date is shown here.</li></ul><p>The Report Item Queue Status section shows the status for all the report items for a selected report in the Report Queue Status section. Only reports that are currently in the queue will have report items. I.e. when the reporting engine has processed all the report items, a job in EC (post–processing job) will merge all the report items into one report. The report items will then disappear.</p><p>The screenshot shows a Monthly Production report with nine subreports. Each of these nine subreports are (in this case) Business Objects reports. Two of them are already processed (GENERATED), one is currently being processed (PROCESSING), and six are still in the queue (NEW) waiting for the reporting engine to pick them up. The status called PROCESSING is done by the external reporting engine. Hence, this is a status not handled by EC. The postprocessing job will only handle report items with status = GENERATED.</p><p>The Purge Report button will set the status for the report items to ERROR and hence remove them from the queue. The postprocessing job will then clean up the report items and set the status on the report to ERROR.</p>
