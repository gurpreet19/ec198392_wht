  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><em>        Transactional
    Inventory module in EC Revenue allows complex        inventory valuations using
    the EC calculation engine. It is a standard        calculation where minimal calculation
    knowledge is required and can be        fully configured through creating EC objects
    and configuration. It has        been designed with the intention of creating
    templates with standard        functionality. And for the cases that do not conform
    to the normal        rules, overrides can be created to cater for the exceptions.    </em></span></p><p>    <strong>Transactional
    Inventory Reconciliation screen</strong>    is used to reconcile the difference
    between two Transactional Inventory Calculation Runs.<br> This functionality will
    only consider the calculation cycles which is run after setting the system attribute
    -    ENABLE_DOC_TRACING as Y.</p><p>    - The screen will first identify the Transactional
    Inventory calculation run document based on the comparison type provided, and
    then it will figure out the    corresponding Document to compare to. <br> - The
    screen further provides the opportunity to compare further at more detailed levels
    by choosing which to analyze    more. The Document can be of type accrual or preceding.</p><h3>    <strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Navigator</strong></h3><p>    The purpose of the
    Navigator is to filter out two Documents to be compared.<br>    It has following
    elements:<br>    <strong><em>- Daytime:</em></strong>    This is the month for
    which the Royalty Calculations are run and Reconciliation is to be done. This
    data element is mandatory.<br>    <strong><em>- Business Unit:</em></strong>    Any

    Group will be managed in the screen. This data element is mandatory.<br>    <strong><em>-

    on the previous parameters.<br>    <strong><em>- Compare Type:</em></strong>    The
    options available for this mandatory field is available in EC codes. There are
    two options for that:<br>    1. To Preceding - it gives the last calculation ran
    with the same settings.<br>    2. To Accrual - it gives the last accrual calculation
    ran with the same settings.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0,
