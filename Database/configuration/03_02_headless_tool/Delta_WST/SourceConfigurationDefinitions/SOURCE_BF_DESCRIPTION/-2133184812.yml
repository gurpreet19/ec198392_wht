  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The business function is used to get the transaction details of the current inventory for a specific product.</p>

    <p>When hydro carbons in a processing plant are transferred between different assets the accounting will be carried out by registering transactions holding a volume pr storage and product. Each transaction is either a debit or credit transaction, meaning that the storage obtains or loses the specific amount of a product. The ownership of a transactional volume can be split between different companies. The split model is chosen by selecting an ownership type and a split type. An ownership type is based on a commercial entity (EC) and will hold an equity share (EC) between the companies. The split type is used to define if the split should be controlled by % or the volume itself. The sum of transactions for each storage will make the current calculated inventory.</p>

    <p>The first section shows the available products for the storage selected in the navigator. When selecting a product the transactional details will show up in the second section.</p>

    <p>The second data section shows each of the transactions for the selected product. A transaction is specified by type, from and to asset, volume, ownership type and owner split type. It will show the ownership volumes based on the split. If a transaction type is &quot;Blend&quot; the row will be read only, meaning that the transaction has been generated by adjustments in the blend values.</p>

    <p>The third section makes it possible to override the ownership split value for a specific / selected transaction. It will also enable a comments attribute to comment each of the overridden values.</p>
