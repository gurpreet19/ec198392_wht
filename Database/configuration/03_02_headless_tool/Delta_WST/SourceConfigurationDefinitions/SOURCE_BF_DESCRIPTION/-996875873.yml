  DESCRIPTION: <p>Actor Maintenance screen is used for creating and maintaining contact group, message contact, delivery address and routing tag of each message contact. The relations can be described as:</p><p>FUNCTIONAL_AREA –&gt; CONTACT_GROUP_SET –&gt; CONTACT_GROUP –&gt; MESSAGE_CONTACT</p><p>In old versions of EC the message contact was organized by functional area and company. When letting external parties maintain their own set of contacts and group them by groups they named, instead of having to use the companies already in the system, the contact group set and the contact group were introduced. Now it is possible to create message group sets for each external party and grant access to these sets to let them maintain their contacts only.</p><p>The class ‘contact group’ is the group of contacts. Previously the company was used which resulted in many dummy companies to get a good name for the contact group. The contact group class is an EC object which means that it is versioned. If that is not necessary the daytime column could be hidden and a class trigger could set it equal to the start date.</p><p>The class ‘message contact’ is also a versioned EC object. If versions are not needed the daytime could be hidden and maintained by a class trigger and set equal to the start date. Now the contact can have unlimited addresses and protocols defined. Previously this was a restricted set.</p><p>Delivery Address and Routing Tag are linked to each Message Contact. In Message Contact, you can either choose the Primary Delivery Address from the popup or type the address as free text if the address you want does not exist in the popup. After you type a new address and save, it will be automatically inserted into the Delivery Address and you can find it in the popup next time.</p><p>The ‘Routing Tag’ is information additional to the transport protocol and address, like ftp, smtp, etc. A typical example of routing tag would be EDI addresses.</p><p>When external parties, like shippers, maintain their own group of contacts, ring fencing can be used. Then typically a Contact Group Set is created for each shipper and access is granted to a unique access role for each shipper. Object partition can be done for Contact Group Set and ring fencing for the relation between Message Contact, Contact Group and Contact Group Set.</p><p>Note that both Contact Group and Message Contact are EC objects, which means they can only be deleted if you set end_date equal to start_date.</p>
