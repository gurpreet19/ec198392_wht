  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Contract Company Splits screen</strong>    is responsible
    for defining the Vendors and Customers for a Contract. This screen has been designed
    for handling single/multiple Vendors and single    Customer for each Contract,
    i.e. it is not allowed to have more than one Customer for a Contract. This will
    be validated by the Save operation.</p><p>    The Vendors and Customers for a
    Contract are connected to the Contract via Split Keys: Vendor Split Key and Customer
    Split Key. These split keys will be    defined for Vendors and Customers even
    if there is only a single Vendor or Customer taking part, i.e. Customer share
    to be 100% in a Customer Split Key to    be able to validate the Contract. And
    Vendors share to be 100% in a Vendor Split Key in a situation when there is just
    one Vendor for the Contract.</p><p>    <strong>When creating a SALE or TA_INCOME
    Contract</strong>    , the system will automatically add the Contract Owner Company
    as one of the Vendors. There must exist a Vendor of type SELF belonging to the
    Contract    Owner Company for this logic to work. The Vendor will have no Bank
    Account assigned meaning that the user must assign a valid Bank Account to the
    Vendor.    Validation rules in the Document General BF (SP.0016) will check that
    a proper Bank Account has been assigned to the Vendor before processing the contract.</p><p>    <strong>When
    creating a PURCHASE or TA_COST Contract</strong>    , the system will automatically
    add the Contract Owner Company as the Customer. There must exist a Customer of
    type SELF belonging to the Contract Owner    Company for this logic to work. The
    Customer will have no Bank Account assigned meaning that the user must assign
    a Bank Account to the Customer. If there    are no Customer payments, then it
    is allowed to use a N/A (not applicable) type of Bank Account. Validation rules
    in the Document General BF (SP.0016) will    check that a proper Bank Account
    has been assigned to the Customer before processing the contract.</p><p>    <u>The
