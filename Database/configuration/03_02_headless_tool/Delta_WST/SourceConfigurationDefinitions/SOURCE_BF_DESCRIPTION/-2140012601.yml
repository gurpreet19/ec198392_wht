  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The main purpose of this screen is to provide an overview of all
    process instances including active, aborted and completed. It consists of four
    sections: a list providing overview info of each process instance, a graphical
    representation of a selected process instance and its progress, a detailed section
    providing info for each node in the process instance, and an extra data panel
    for presenting other process related data.&nbsp;</p><p>The instance list section
    includes the following information for each instance: Instance ID, the overall
    State of the process, Process Template / Definition used to create the instance,
    Start / End (Execution period). The State field is common for all process instances
    and has one of the following values: active, aborted, completed.</p><p>As there
    might be quite a lot of process instances the list can be filtered in several
    ways. It is possible to filter by execution time, process template and/or date
    parameters given into the instance. Typically processes are executed at a different
    time than the period context it uses for data reading and data manipulation. For
    example an allocation process can be run the first of month manipulating data
    for the previous month. If the previous month time period is assigned to the process
    by an input parameter named START_OF_CALC, this parameter can be selected in the
    Date param dropdown. The list will then display all process instances with the
    input parameter START_OF_CALC between the selected From Date and To Date in the
    navigator. The selected input parameter will be added as a property to the list
    and process instances are sorted by this property.</p><p>If full privileges are
    granted to the user, this screen will also provide the possibility to manipulate
    the process instance with the following actions:</p><ul><li>Abort Process: Terminate
    the execution of a process. The process instance will finish execution of the
    current active action (if any) and set the state to aborted. Note that this action
    is irreversible and only an active instance can be aborted.</li><li>Delete Process:
    Delete process instance and remove all BPM logs related to this process. Note
    that only aborted and completed process instances can be deleted. This action
    is irreversible but it will not manipulate data created by delegating actions.</li></ul><p>An
    interactive graphical representation will display when a process instance is selected.
    It shows the execution overview of the process instance. The diagram can be moved
    and zoomed in/out for better viewing.&nbsp;</p><p>The right panel shows detail
    information about the process instance. The DETAIL tab by default shows information
    about the process such as the process id, deployment id etc, when a node in the
    diagram is clicked, the DETAIL tab shows the node information. The VARIABLE tab
    lists variables on the selected node instance/process instance. Variables that
    hold data sets are annotated with icon before its name. To view all data sets
    generated in the selected process instance, select "All Items". The section below
    the variable list displays all data sets held by the selected variable. The data
    set can be downloaded or viewed by clicking the buttons under this section. Note
    that not all variables in the selected node/process instance are listed. To include
    a variable in this section, it must be assigned with a label. Label assignation
    can be done by calling ECBPM In-Process API from a node''s On-Entry Script or
    On-Exit Script. The TASK tab by default shows all available tasks of current process
    instance, when a user task node is clicked, the TASK tab will show the specific
    task related to this node. There is a button in the TASK tab which navigates to
    the TO DO LIST screen for further processing the task. The LOGS on the right panel
    shows process event logs and node property details. The details will provide information
    about the impact the node has had on the process instance. The content will differ
    based on the type of node and the actions the node execute; a start node is part
    of the initialization of the instance and will display all input variables to
    the process, a node executing a business action will typically show the result
    of the business action and the output variables configured to be applied to the
    context of the process instance. Certain return values/properties may connect
    additional resources. For example the calculation business action will expose
    a link to a detailed calculation log.</p><p><br></p><p>The Extra section is designed
    for user to present concerned data which might be affected by the process instance.
    The configuration of this section is done on Process Overview Configuration Screen.&nbsp;</p>'
