  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used for matching the output nomination on the contract with the output nomination from the downstream shipper(s).&nbsp;</p><p>There are at least two types of matching:<br />Matching of aggregated values<br />Matching of upstream/downstream shipper-pairs.</p><p>To learn more about the aggregated matching please read GD.0005 &ndash; Aggregated Exit Point Matching.</p><p>Contracts can (optionally) request a matching service whereby the upstream and downstream output nominations are compared. If any discrepancy is found, a rule&nbsp;for an adjustment can be applied. For instance the larger of the two can be adjusted to the smaller. Also, if there is no message received from the downstream&nbsp;shipper, the upstream nomination will prevail as the valid value.</p><p>Matching is configured in CO.2023 &ndash; Maintain Shipper Pair</p><p>The nomination is sent in a message and the quantity is spesified pr. hour. The message loader handles the parsing of the message and inserts the data in the&nbsp;database.</p><p>When a new output nomination is received from either the upstream or downstream shipper, there will be an offset of time in which the counterparty must send a&nbsp;nomination message. When this nomination message is received, the lesser of rule should automatically be applied (by the business function that is processing the&nbsp;message). If the counterparty does not send a new nomination within the offset, the previous nomination will be used. When the re-nomination is lesser than the&nbsp;previous nomination, the lesser of rule could be applied at once (because it will always be the lesser then the previous nomination).</p><p>Lesser Rule Qty column is set by the message loader when the nominations are received. If no matching required, this column should be populated by the value in&nbsp;Upstream Nominated Qty. The lesser rule quantity will be handeled as an output nomination by the messaging system.</p>
