  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This Business function is used to transfer ownership of products on a stream. How the data in this screen is used depends on the calculation rules. A typical application is stock transfers in a product allocation.</p>

    <p>Two types of ownership reassignment are supported:</p>

    <p>1. From a Profit Centre and Company to a Company. In this case the &quot;to&quot; company will get a quantity of the product produced by that profit centre from the &quot;from&quot; company.</p>

    <p>2. From Profit Centre and Company to Companies in Commercial Entity. This changes the ownership so that the quantity is now owned by the stakeholders in the commercial entity, pro rata their equity.</p>

    <p>There is also two different ways of specifying the quantity to transfer. The simplest is to give the transfer quantity directly. The second option is to give it as a percentage. What this percentage is taken from depends on the calculation rules (project specific), but typical examples would be opening stock and/or production.</p>

    <p>The two data sections are independent; the selected stream can use both. The user must enter either Mass (kg) or Mass (%), but can&rsquo;t enter both. The streams that you can select in the navigator must be part of the stream set dedicated to stream ownership reassignment.</p>

    <p>The companies that are selectable in the &quot;From Company Name&quot; popup depend on the selected profit centre. The companies must have a relation to the profit centre through commercial entity and equity share.</p>

    <p>The data in screen are not instantiated daily; a user will have to insert new records when necessary.</p>
