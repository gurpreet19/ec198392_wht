  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Monthly List Validation screen</strong>    is used to maintain
    List of Stream Items, their Calc Methods and Conversion Factors regarding the
    Validation process of Monthly Stream Items.<br>    Quantity numbers are entered
    according to a predefined List containing a list of Stream Items. The lists of
    stream items are defined in Input List screen    (BF CD.0035).</p><p>    <u>For
    each stream item up to 6 different quantities may be entered:</u><br>    - One
    Volume quantity<br>    - One Energy quantity<br>    - One Mass quantity<br>    -
    3 Extra quantities, any UOM</p><p>    <u>Each stream item is defined with a master
    UOM group. That is V for Volume, M for Mass or E for Energy.</u>    <br> The quantity
    is normally entered in the master UOM and other quantities are calculated by the
    system using conversion logic and cascade logic.</p><h3>    <strong style="color:
    rgb(0, 0, 153);">Navigator</strong></h3><p>    Navigator filters List Objects
    based on a Month chosen.<br>    The user should be sure the Instantiation is done
    for the chosen Month.</p><h3>        <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">List
    Object Section</strong></h3><p>    The section lists List Objects found according
    to the Navigator settings.</p><h3>    <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Stream
    Item Section</strong></h3><p>    This section lists all Stream Items connected
    to the chosen List.<br>    The user is able to view and modify Conversion Factors
    for each Stream Item in the List.<br>    Each Stream Item is defined with a calculation
    method (STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD).</p><p>    <u>Valid values for CM (Calculation
    Method):</u><br>    <strong><em>- IP</em></strong>    : Manual input or by interface.<br>    <strong><em>-
    SK</em></strong>    Calculated using a split key. The split keys are defined in
    the CD module.<br>    <strong><em>- FO:</em></strong>    Calculated using a formula.
    The formula is defined on the stream item in the CD module.<br>    <strong><em>-
    EK:</em></strong>    Calculated using an exceptional split key, i.e. the number
    has been calculated based on a new split key share entered by the user.<br>    <strong><em>-
    OW:</em></strong>    The user has overwritten the master quantity on a FO or a
    SK stream item. This means the cascade will not include the stream item again
    in any new cascade    operation.<br>    <strong><em>- CO:</em></strong>    The
    number is a constant.<br>    <strong><em>- SP:</em></strong>    The number is
    coming from SP (Sales and Purchases module) and is a sum of quantities from one
    or more SP documents.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0, 153,
    0);">RESET SELECTED CALC METHOD</span></strong><br>    The button enables to reset
    the Calc Method for the selected Stream Item.<br>    If the user has overwritten
    the master quantity on a FO or a SK stream item the CM (Calc Method) column will
    change to OW and the way to bring back the    number and CM (Calc Method) is to
    press the button.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">RESET
    SELECTED CONVERSION FACTORS</span></strong><br>    The button enables to reset
    the Conversion Factor for the selected Stream Item.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span
    style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">VIEW CASCADE</span></strong><br>    The button
    explains how the selected number was calculated using other numbers.</p>'
