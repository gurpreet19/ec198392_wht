  DESCRIPTION: <p>&nbsp;</p><p>This business function is used to enter minimum and maximum availability for a nomination point. The navigator uses a default navigation model where Nomination Point is the target.</p><p>The navigation model uses by default TRAN_COMMERCIAL, but a different navigational model can be used by sending the navigational model as an argument from the treeview (argument NAV_MODEL). When using a different navigational model it is important to be aware of the owner of the data class and the target must be the same object.</p><p>The implement project can also create their own classes to store availability values which have an alternative owner for this business function.</p><p>Mandatory arguments which are needed in the url are only CLASS. When using this BF to store availability on a different owner class than Nomination Point the implementation team needs to send in TARGET as well.</p>
