  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>VAT Code screen</strong>    is used to maintain the
    VAT (Value Added Tax) Codes that are in use by the    system.<br>    VAT Codes
    vary depending on which countries one is selling to or buying    from.<br>    Country
    is part of the primary key for the VAT objects as there may be a    VAT Code A0
    for Norway with a certain rate, but at the same time there    may be an A0 VAT
    code for UK with another rate.</p><p>    <u>The VAT Code objects are divided into
    two types:</u><br>    <strong>1. Income</strong>    - to be used with Sales, Tariff
    Income, and Journal Entry contracts<br>    <strong>2. Cost</strong>    - to be
    used with Purchase and Tariff Cost contracts</p><p>    <u>Note </u>    that for
    the contract configuration the system will require a VAT Code    object with rate
    0.0% even if there is no VAT applicable for the contract.</p><p>    The attribute
    Country Validation can be set on each VAT Code object. The    VAT Country Setup
    screen (BF CD.0134) can be used to setup the related    countries of a VAT Code
    object. <br> Multiple countries can be added to each    relation. <u>The following
    types of relationships can be configured:</u><br>    <strong><em>- VAT Code Customer
    Country:</em></strong>    Possible countries of the VAT Code object to be compared
    to the country of    the customer of the contract in case of Sales, Tariff Income,
    and Journal    Entry type of contracts.<br>    <strong><em>- VAT Code Origin Country:</em></strong>    Possible
    countries of the VAT Code object to be compared to the origin of    product delivery
    of the transaction.<br>    <strong><em>- VAT Code Destination Country:</em></strong>    Possible
    countries of the VAT Code object to be compared to the destination    of the product
    delivery of the transaction.<br>    <strong><em>- VAT Code Vendor Country:</em></strong>    Possible
    countries of the VAT Code object to be compared to the country of    the vendor
    of the contract in case of Purchase and Tariff Cost type of    contracts.</p><p>    A
    special country Any Country can be used if a relation can be set to any    country.</p><p>    The
    setup is used in the <strong>Financial Document Validation</strong>.<br>    <u>To
    pass the validation the following rules apply:</u><br>    <strong><em>VAT Code
    Customer Country: </em></strong><br>    The countries in this relation will be
    used to match the country of the    customer of a Sale/Tariff Income contract.
    If no country is configured, the    customer country on the document has to be
    either the same as the country    of the VAT Code, or country Any Country. In
    other cases, either a matching    country or country Any Country should be found
    in the relation setup.<br>    <strong><em>VAT Code Vendor Country: </em></strong><br>    The
    countries in this relation will be used to match the country of the    vendor
    of a Purchase/Tariff Cost contract. If no country is configured, the    vendor
    country on the document has to be either the same as the country of    the VAT
    Code, or Any Country. In other cases, either a matching country or    country
    Any Country should be found in the relation setup.<br>    <strong><em>Origin Country:
    </em></strong><br>    The countries in this relation will be used to match the
    origin country of    a document transaction when system attribute ORIG_COUNTRY_AT_TRANS
    is set    to Y.<br>    If no country is configured, the transaction origin country
    has to be    either the same as the country of the VAT Code, or country Any Country.<br>    In
    other cases, either a matching country or Any Country should be found in    the
    relation setup.<br>    <strong><em>Destination Country: </em></strong><br>    The
    countries in this relation will be used to match the destination    country of
    a document transaction when system attribute DEST_COUNTRY_AT_TRANS is set to Y.<br>    If
    no country is configured, the transaction destination country has to be    either
    the same as the country of the VAT Code object, or country Any    Country.<br>    In
    other cases, either a matching country or Any Country should be found in    the
    relation setup.</p><p>    <u>Note</u>    that when creating a new VAT Code object
    the system will automatically    generate the Code of the new object as a concatenation
    of the VAT Code    attribute and the Code of the country associated with the new
    VAT object.</p>'
