  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This screen is used to link Wells to Deferment Groups. This is a many to many connection, meaning that one Well can be part of many Deferment Groups and one Deferment Group can include many Wells.</p>

    <p>The connections have a start and end date, where end date is exclusive.</p>

    <p>When using a Deferment Group in the deferment screens, the connected Wells from this screen will be automatically inserted in the &ldquo;Well Information&rdquo; section upon save. The end user can delete individual Wells afterwards or add new Wells to the deferment event to get a correct list of wells being involved in this event. This Deferment Group is meant to be a way of getting 90%-100% of the wells involved correct upon save.</p>
