  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used when daily steam stream data is available. Data can be entered manually or loaded automatically. The BF requires one entry per stream per day, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all steam streams that are part of a stream set for this screen. Thus, this BF has value instantiation for the Day start where blank line for all measured steam streams will be inserted.</p>

    <p>A separate measurement type for steam volume, STEAM_VOL_CWE, has been introduced. In this context, &quot;CWE&quot; is short for Cold Water Equivalents and represents the volume of cold water that would condense from any given volume of steam upon cooling.</p>

    <p>The second section lists derived streams. Derived streams are calculated on the fly and are not editable. Configuration of derived streams is done in the Stream Formula Editor (CO.0081). All streams that have GRS_VOL_METHOD=&rsquo;FORMULA&rsquo; will be calculated using the formula configured in the Stream Formula Editor.</p>

    <p>Mandatory navigator level for Well and Stream screens can be configured in CO.1008 Maintain User Settings.</p>
    <p> - From category &ldquo;Customer Setting&rdquo;, select setting &ldquo;Custom Mandatory Navigation&rdquo;.</p>
    <p> - Add respective user role which required custom navigation.</p>
    <p> - Available custom navigation level to configure are &ldquo;AREA&rdquo;, &ldquo;FCTY_CLASS_1&rdquo;, &ldquo;PRODUCTIONUNIT&rdquo;.</p>
