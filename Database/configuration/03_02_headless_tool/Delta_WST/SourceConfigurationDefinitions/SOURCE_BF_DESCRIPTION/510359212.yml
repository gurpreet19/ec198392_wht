  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to record the monthly or daily component analysis for a delivery point.</p><p>The column &quot;Sampling method&quot; defines whether the data relates to spot, single day (&quot;Day Sampler&quot;) or the month (&quot;Month Sampler&quot;). If used for both monthly and&nbsp;daily data, typicall usage is to have one monthly record and one daily record for each day of the month.</p><p>The &lsquo;Generate Days&rsquo; button will generate daily component analysis for the month. To get a monthly or spot component analysis the insert buttons should be used.&nbsp;Components are instantiated when an analysis is created. The component set &lsquo;Sales Delivery Component Set&rsquo; is used to modify the list of component analysis to&nbsp;instantiate.</p><p>The total numbers entered in the component analysis can be viewed in the last &lsquo;Sum&rsquo; row. No validation exists to make sure that the total is always 100. If needed&nbsp;the &lsquo;Normalize&rsquo; button can be used to scale the components to 100%.</p><p>The &lsquo;Mol &lt;-&gt; Wt&rsquo; button will calculate either weight or mole percent for each component if one of them is missing.</p><p>The data in the top section of the screen is presented in descending date order (i.e. earliest at the top). The monthly data must be dated on the first day of the month&nbsp;(and will therefore appear on the top).</p>
