  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to list water stream data for a Period (From &ndash; To Date) and for only one Stream. Data can be entered manually or loaded automatically. The BF requires one entry per stream per day, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all water streams that are part of a stream set for this screen. Thus, this BF has value instantiation for the Day start where blank line for all measured water streams will be inserted.</p>
