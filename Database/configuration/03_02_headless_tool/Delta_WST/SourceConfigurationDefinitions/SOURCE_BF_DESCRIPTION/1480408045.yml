  DESCRIPTION: "<p>The stream concept in EC is very central to the entire functional\
    \ operation of the Energy Component system.  It represents movement of all sorts\
    \ of entities (e.g oil, water, NLG, flare gas, power fluid) between junction points,\
    \ called &ldquo;nodes&rdquo;, in a logical flow schematic, called a &ldquo;stream\
    \ node diagram&rdquo;.  The stream concept is represented in the system by a dedicated\
    \ and highly configurable object class &ldquo;STREAM&rdquo;.  Together with nodes,\
    \ streams form the core set-up for creating allocation networks in EC.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Streams can represent:\n<p>-\tReal physical measurements, where data for one\
    \ physical meter is transferred directly from the DSC system and stored as data\
    \ for the stream.</p>\n<p>-\tReal physical measurements, where data for many parallel\
    \ physical meters are captured and averaged by DCS system before transfer and\
    \ storage as data for a stream.</p>\n<p>-\tDerived measurements that do not exist\
    \ in the DCS system, but can be produced by applying mathematical and/or logical\
    \ operations to a group of physical measurements.  A simple example is total flare,\
    \ which might be calculated as the sum of low pressure and high pressure flare.\
    \ Data for derived streams are not stored, but calculated on the fly whenever\
    \ required.  Depending on the complexity of the logic and calculations, the derived\
    \ streams can be implemented as &ldquo;formula&rdquo; -streams (CO.0081) or &ldquo;derived&rdquo;\
    \ -streams.  The latter involves PL/SQL package programming.</p>\n<p>-\tDerived\
    \ theoretical data can also be represented by streams.  In this case, there is\
    \ no physical rate-meter providing input, but rather a collection of sensor data\
    \ that is interpreted by EC in order to produce a theoretical flow rate.  Various\
    \ Aggregates of such theoretical rates may be combined in a derived stream.</p>\n\
    <p>-\tCalculated measurements, where data is calculated by the allocation program\
    \ and stored in the database. Data for calculated measurements cannot be edited\
    \ by the end user.</p>\n\n<p>Stream objects are mostly defined for measurements\
    \ or theoretical rates occurring between various gathering points in the configured\
    \ system.  It is not common practice to define stream objects for the flow between\
    \ a single well and the well flowline gathering station (e.g. the test station).\
    \  Often, this would require the asset configuration team to create thousands\
    \ of streams initially, and perhaps 60 pr. week on a regular basis (1 pr. phase\
    \ pr. new well).  Fortunately, this is handled automatically be the system.  The\
    \ allocation process is creating all the necessary well streams in memory on the\
    \ fly as virtual streams, thus eliminating the need for manual creation of individual\
    \ well flowline streams</p>\n"
