  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to connect wells to streams. This is needed to be able to allocate dispositions to wells, where only a subset of the wells should be charged for the disposition. Examples of dispositions can be flare or fuel consumptions.</p>

    <p>The connections have a start and end daytime, where end daytime is exclusive.</p>

    <p>Also, there is a new view (V_STRM_WELL_DAY_CONN) was developed to calculate the fraction of a day the stream and well is connected. On top of this view, a data class (DV_ STRM_WELL_CONN_DAY_DATA) was created to display the production day per well total fraction of the day the well is connected to the stream.</p>
