  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used when creating a contract based on another contract or a template contract.</p><p>This business function will be a staging area where the users can update data on the contract before it is created. As soon as the contract is created all data&nbsp;manipulation should be done through the regular business functions. Projects may decide differently. Typically this business function can be very helpful to the&nbsp;contract in a complete state faster than through the regular business function. The projects are free to add as many attributes as they like in the detail section. These&nbsp;attributes can the further map to different areas (EC Transport, Ec Sale, and EC Revenue) in the product.</p><p>The first datasection of the screen will list all pending contracts. By clicking the &ldquo;Create Contract&rdquo; button the selected contract will be created. The details about the&nbsp;contract can be seen in the last data section.</p><p>Note that the Create Contract button implements a user exit. This means that the projects can decide what is being created behind the button. As in default setting, the Create Contract will copy features from EC Transport, EC Sales, EC Revenue; i.e. Contract Attributes, Contract Parties, Nomination Point, Contract Accounts, etc.</p><p>Note that if required this screen can be duplicated in the treeview so that different user have different access to different set of attributes. Just change the class name on the url.</p>
