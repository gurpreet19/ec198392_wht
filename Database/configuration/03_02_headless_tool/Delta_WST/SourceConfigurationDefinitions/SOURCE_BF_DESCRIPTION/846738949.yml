  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This business function is used to display and store global attributes for the allocation. It will be project specific to configure the global attributes. As product default, this BF does not have any attributes mapped to the screen. The projects have the opportunity to add 10 values, 5 dates and 10 text attributes.</p>

    <p>Versioning of the attributes is done similarly as if there were an owner object, and the list of version shown in the right side will only show the different values each attribute has had.</p>

    <p>On insert all existing values will be copied to the new record, and the user may modify the attributes that they want to change. If the user does not want version handling, then instead of inserting new records the user could just keep the first record and modify the attributes in that record only. In such a case, rerunning an old allocation may not necessarily result in the same result as the first calculation.</p>
