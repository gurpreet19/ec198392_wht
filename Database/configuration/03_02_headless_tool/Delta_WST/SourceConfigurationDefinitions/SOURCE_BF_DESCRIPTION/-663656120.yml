  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used by the scheduler/plant operator to plan for maintenance periods and other events that have an impact on the production to each&nbsp;storage. Typical usage of this business function is to enter a start and end date/time for the event and choose from a predefined list of events. The events are&nbsp;configured in a separate configuration function (CO.2058 &ndash; Process Train Event Profile).</p><p>The Event Details will be initiated based on the selected event type. The user may select Storage to see the impact. The impact will be represented as a reduced&nbsp;rundown to the storage. The user will not be able to change the rundown. The figures are calculated based on the Train Storage Yield and the maintenance event.</p><p>By entering an event for a process train the underlying production forecasts on daily and sub-daily level for the storage(s) that the process train produces to will be&nbsp;affected.</p><p>Further, the screen does not prevent the user from changing the event type for an existing event or to delete events.</p>
