  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    The Data Mapping objects are using Split Key objects for the
    cases where    only a share of the amount/quantity is to be included in the Data
    Mapping    document.</p><p>    <strong> Split Item Other screen</strong>    is
    used to define the objects that <em> Other Split Key </em> will use for its    split
    objects.<br>    The typical example can be the split on Allowable Cost and Non
    Allowable    Cost.</p><p>    <strong> Other Split Keys </strong> business function
    is for use where any other Split    Key types just do not fit.</p><p>    The Split
    Key types like company, product etc. all apply splits using one    particular
    criteria: company or product etc. <br> Occasionally there is a    requirement
    on a Split based on two or more criteria: company and field, and this case&nbsp;<em>Other
    Split Key </em> can be used.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Other Split Keys
    are defined in CD.0046.</span></p>'
