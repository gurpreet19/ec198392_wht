  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>

    <p>The object class Disposition Type holds a list of available ways to distribute the well production. E.g. the gas production from the well may be used to support:</p>
    <p>-  Fuel Gas</p>
    <p>-  Flare Gas</p>
    <p>-  Injection Gas</p>
    <p>-  Export Gas</p>
    <p>Then all these will be different Disposition Types for gas. Behind a Disposition Type (e.g. Fuel Gas) there might be more than one physical stream measuring fuel gas. Each stream will then have a relation to the Disposition Type that stream represents.</p>
