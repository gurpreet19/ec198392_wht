  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Project Data Extract Accrual screen </strong>    is
    used to create Data Extract documents based on the Data Extract setup object and
    the Data Extract setup list configuration.<br>    The Data Extract document will
    hold Data Entry data based on the configuration of the tags in the Data Extract
    Setup List screen. This screen is for    Accrual document and values. There is
    another screen where actuals are created and maintained. When running Accrual
    a preceding document will be an actual    if exists, if not - an accrual will
    be used if exists.</p><p>   <strong> Navigator: </strong> By selecting a Data
    Extract setup object in the Navigator the user get all the Data Extract documents
    created with this Data Extract in the table component    below.</p><p>    <strong><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Create New Data Extract</span> button: </strong>
    To create a new Data Extract the user must enter a Data Extract period (month)
    which corresponds with the Data Entry month the user wants to pick up values for,    and
    click on the Create New Data Extract button.</p><p>    If an Unverified or Unapproved
    Data Extract document for the same Data Extract setup and the same period already
    exists you will get an error. Hence, if it    is Verified or Approved, the new
    Data Extract document will use the last Verified or Approved Data Extract document
    as its Previous Data Extract. This way    the user has several revisions of one
    period and one Data Extract setup. The values of the previous Data Extract document
    will be visible in the columns    called <strong><em>Previous Amount/Qty</em></strong>.</p><p>    <strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Verify</strong>    and <strong><span style="color:
    rgb(0, 153, 0);">Un-verify</span> buttons: </strong> they will change the data
    status. Verified or Approved data cannot be edited.</p><p>    - For Actual Data
    Extract documents the monetary and quantity values are never editable.<br>    -
    For Forecast Data Extract documents the values are editable if the Data Extract
    setup object is set up to be populated manually.</p><p>    <strong><span style="color:
    rgb(0, 153, 0);"> Trace Value</span> button: </strong> it will open a popup that
    will display all the values that went into producing the single number.</p>'
