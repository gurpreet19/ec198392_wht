  DESCRIPTION: '<p>In the navigator the user selects which forecast case to view or
    edit. The selection criteria may include a field group. The user may then select
    among the field groups that have the field group type selected when the forecast
    case was set up. </p><p>In the table below the navigator an overview of the quantities
    for the selected forecast case is shown. The numbers in this table are yearly
    numbers by field with a sum row at the bottom. If a field group was selected in
    the navigator, this table will only include the fields that are members of that
    group.</p><p>Then a month-by-month table showing monthly numbers by field is displayed.
    This table also includes an adjustment line. The content of this line is the difference
    between last year?s December accrual numbers and the actual December numbers.
    All quantity data entry will be done through this table.</p><p>At the very bottom
    of the screen is a section where the user can enter comments. Any number of comments
    can be inserted by normal insert functionality, not necessarily four rows as in
    the example screenshot above. The comments will be by forecast case, product and
    field.</p><p>All parts of the forecast case will be populated when the Populate
    Forecast Case on the Properties screen is pressed. The quantity part of this logic
    will work as follows:<br>?&nbsp;The numbers in the Plan Qty column will be copied
    from the referenced quantity forecast case that is selected on the Properties
    panel by using the selected stream items for the forecast object.<br>?&nbsp;If
    the Populate Method is PLAN, then all columns except the Plan Qty column will
    initially be empty. The user will then have to enter Commercial Adjustment, Swap
    Adjustment and Sales Qty. Available Sale will be Plan Qty less the two adjustments.
    Inventory Movement will be Available Sale less Sales Qty.<br>?&nbsp;In the month-by-month
    table the rows will get status PLAN if the Populate Method is PLAN or if the month
    in question is later than the Forecast Case month. In the screenshot above, the
    forecast case?s month is May, and therefore the June thru December months are
    editable.<br>?&nbsp;For the months after the month of the Forecast Case, the adjustment
    quantities and the sales quantity will be copied from the official forecast case
    for the previous month. The user may change them if necessary. The plan quantity
    will be copied from the connected quantity forecast case. This will trigger a
    recalculation of available sales quantity and inventory movement.<br>?&nbsp;For
    the months up to and including the month of the Forecast Case object, actual numbers
    will be copied into forecast case. The Plan Qty will be actual numbers copied
    from the selected stream items. The Commercial Adjustment will sum all as-is quantities
    from the quantities module for the selected stream item category for the month
    and field in question. The Swap Adjustment quantity will be calculated the same
    way using the selected stream item category for Swap Adjustments. Available Sale
    will then be Plan Qty less Commercial Adjustment and Swap Adjustment. The Sales
    Qty will be sum of all quantities sold from the field in the month in question.
    This lookup is done by finding the line items selling from the field in question
    that belong to transactions with point of sale date within the month in question.
    The documents that these transactions belong to must be set to BOOKED. Finally,
    Inventory Movement will be the difference between Available Sale and Sales Qty.
    The status will be ACCRUAL if any of the actual numbers are ACCRUAL. All actual
    numbers must have status FINAL for the record to get status FINAL.<br>?&nbsp;An
    exception to this will be made to the Sales Qty for the month after the forecast
    case?s month, i.e. June in the example screenshot above. There will be a lifting
    plan for the cargos in this month, and therefore this number will be fetched from
    the actual tables and not from the official forecast case for the previous month.
    The number will however still be editable for the user to change if necessary.<br>?&nbsp;On
    the Prior Year Adjustment line the user has to enter any adjustments and the Sales
    Qty. The Available Sale and the Inventory Movement will then be calculated. For
    liquids shipped by cargos, there will normally not be any adjustments to the sales
    quantity. This means that any adjustment to the available sales quantity will
    only influence the inventory movement. The sales quantity cell will nonetheless
    be editable for the user to enter any number.</p><p>Populate method = PLAN</p><p>?&nbsp;Cost

    (monetary values on the contract documents) for the Contract, Product and Company
    in question. Only documents which are booked and where the transaction date is
    within the actual month, are considered. This sum divided by the Purchase Qty
    (ref. Purchase Qty column above in Quantities screen) gives us the Local Cost
    Price. Not editable. After Plan Date = Cost Price * Forex. Not editable.<br>?&nbsp;Local
    Sales Price: Local Sales Price = Sales Price * Forex. Not editable. <br></p>'
