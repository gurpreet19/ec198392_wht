  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to store records which hold gas lift rate for specified &ldquo;Choke Size&rdquo; and &ldquo;Diff Pressure&rdquo;. Values entered for choke size and diff pressure will tell the gas flow. It would be quite accurate and would be a good enough estimation. For a more accurate result, the AGA calculation has to be used.</p>
