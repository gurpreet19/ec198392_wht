  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This Business Function is used to register trucked oil volumes
    transported to/from/between facility streams in the EC production. Below a list
    specifying the different possible setups (<em>Transfer Types): </em></p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Export
    (only registering volume being trucked from a facility stream).</li><li>Import
    (only registering volume being trucked to a facility stream).</li><li>Internal
    Transfer (registering both a source and target stream as well as figures shared
    by both streams).</li></ul><p>For <em>Transfer Type Export </em>and <em>Import
    </em>the <em>To Stream </em>field is deactivated as values then are only registered
    against a single stream.</p><p>For <em>Transfer Type </em>= <em>Internal Transfer
    </em>data will be "shared" between the source stream (<em>Stream</em>) and target
    stream (<em>To Stream</em>). This means that the same gross volume, net volume
    and water volume will be returned for both streams. The target stream can be at
    a different facility. The <em>To Stream </em>drop-down is, therefore, an operational
    group model stream navigator. If target streams belong to a different facility
    the user entering data into EC must be set up with proper access.</p><p>Below
    some simple illustrations of the different setups:</p><p><u>Export </u></p><p>A
    truck connects to a given facility stream and loads a certain amount of oil. In
    this setup, the target is of no interest. E.g. could be trucked to a 3rd party
    facility not modeled within EC.</p><p><u>Import </u></p><p>A truck arrives at
    the given facility, connects to a given facility stream and delivers a certain
    amount of oil. In this setup the source is of no interest, only the oil volume
    received at the facility. E.g. could import from a 3rd party facility not modeled
    within EC.</p><p><u>Internal Transfer </u></p><p>A truck transports a certain
    amount of oil from one facility stream to another. The target stream can be at
    the same or a different facility.</p><p>Field <em>Grs Estimated </em>is normally
    only registered for Transfer Type = <em>Internal Transfer. </em>This is then normally
    the estimated volume loaded into the truck. The <em>Grs Actual, BS&amp;W </em>and
    <em>Free Water </em>are typically measured at the target stream. Free water is
    typically water settled during transport and will be drained of from the truck
    prior to unloading the truck into the target stream.</p><p>Net Volume is calculated
    as Grs Actual * (1-(BSW%/100)).</p>'
