  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to enable and disable attributes and set validation rules on attributes on individual objects in data classes. This BF overrides the configuration stored in Class Validation (CO.1031).</p><p>The first popup in the navigator lists all classes of type OBJECT which have the “Include_In_Validation” class property enabled.</p><p>When the class is selected the group model navigator will appear. This is the operational group model by default, but can be changed in the url. The target for the group model is the class selected in the first popup.</p><p>The next data section lists all DATA classes which have the “Include_In_Validation” class property enabled, and where the selected OBJECT class is the owner, and the name of the class does not end with ‘_ALLOC’.</p><p>Versions can be created and seen in the data section to the left. A version of the configuration is valid until a new version starts. When a new version is created the old configuration is copied to the new version. A version applies to both tabs.</p><p>The first tab allows the user to mark attributes that should not be editable on the selected data class. The list of attributes visible on the left side are those that are not:</p><ul><li>Part of the primary key.</li><li>Mandatory.</li><li>Functions.</li><li>Relations (relations stored in CLASS_RELATION).</li><li>Disabled.</li></ul><p>The second tab allows the user the opportunity to add validation rules to attributes on the data class for the selected object. The list of attributes will be the same as in the first tab, but will&nbsp;additionally&nbsp;exclude attributes that are not NUMBER or INTEGER.</p><p>Using Min/Max means that a given value must be inside a given range. The percentage is used when the entered values is inside a percentage of yesterday's (last) entered value for the object. Using both min/max and percent is not allowed.</p><p>The "Copy To" button is used to copy all the configuration in the selected class to another object.</p><h4>Behavior in BF’s:</h4><p>When the "Not Editable" flag is set on an attribute for an object, the user is not allowed to enter a value on the attribute.</p><p>When a warning occurs, the attribute value will appear in yellow. The user is allowed to save when there are warnings.</p><p>When an error occurs, the value will appear in red. The user is not allowed to save that value. Note that the screens will stop the user from entering values that are not valid, but there can still be data in the system that is wrong. This will typically occur when data is coming in from other sources.</p><h4>Rules:</h4><p>When the configuration is interpreted there are some rules. The following are the levels where configuration can be set:</p><ul><li>(Access).</li><li>Class meta – Standard Class configuration.</li><li>Presentation syntax. Vieweditable can be set individually on attributes and objects.</li><li>Class Validation.</li><li>Object Validation.</li></ul><p>The rule for ‘Not Editable’ is that if any level set editable to false (not allowed to change) then the underlying levels cannot turn it on again.</p><p>The rule for Mandatory is the same as above. If any of the levels sets a value to mandatory, the underlying levels cannot turn it off.</p>
