  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen is used to maintain forecasting input nomination location as export values from nomination location. Ordinarily, these values would be loaded into the system via messages, typically from a coordinator who collect forecast values from the production units. However this screen may be used to view, edit, delete or add values. Existing values can be modified and new values for new events (dates) can be added. The values are stored per nomination location. Depending on which combination of those is selected in the navigator, different sets of data will be shown in the data section.</p><p>The user selects a date range, Business Unit and [or Nomination Location] and Forecast and [or Series], from the navigator at the top of the screen and presses the &quot;Go...&quot; button. The planning period details are then populated in the Forecast Input Nomination Location [FCST_NOMLOC_DAY_STATUS] table. It is now possible to add, edit or delete values for individual planning periods in the Forecast Input Nomination Location table.</p><p>This screen takes NAV_MODEL, TARGET, CLASS and BF_PROFILE as parameters on the treeview to make it possible for projects to create separate screens for different nomination locations. E.g. nomination location at a gas processing facility could have some different attributes than nomination location at a customer meter.</p>
