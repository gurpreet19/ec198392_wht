  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen is used to graphically display the Storage level for a period. In the scheduling process, it can be very valuable to view the storage evolution in a graphical fashion, typically showing the storage level for each day in month. Hence in EC a graphical presentation is provided along with the actual data in order to have an immediate visual feedback during the scheduling process. </p><p> The same tool is also convenient to use during the month showing a combination of official data and forecasted information. Multiple receipt scenarios (Official Daily Receipt - CP.0011) can be viewed to see what would happen if e.g. production / terminal receipt levels differ from official plan and hence help schedulers making adjustments. </p><p> The max level and min level shows the levels of the selected storage and its tanks. The Storage level is normally calculated based on the planned/official production deducting planned/official nominations. The nomination table displays nominations where nominated date is within the selected month for selected storage. When the nominated quantity/date is updated the associated account transaction is updated. To read more about transaction see Lifting Account Transaction Rules. Any changes done to nominated date and/or nominated quantity will be reflected in the graph, given that no B/L Date & Qty is persisted for the given nomination. </p><p> The nomination in RED denotes that it is not included as part of the calculation of the storage level graph. </p><p> Note that if the Storage type on storage is &quot;Import&quot;  then the calculation for storage level is reversed. This means lifting is the input to the storage and forecast/official numbers are output of the storage. </p><p> To support operations that use sub daily data there is a column for storing the Nominated date and time and BL date and time. </p><p> A new nomination can be inserted in the screen and can be connected to an existing cargo or left blank. Nominations which have not been connected to a cargo can be done so by a popup on column Cargo No which shows tentative cargoes. To generate a new cargo based on inserted nomination in this screen can be done in the Nomination Entry screen. </p><p> There is custom settings, &quot;Include all parcels on a cargo in Schedule Lifting&quot; to set the nomination showing either to filter by selected storage or display all nomination with same cargo no with the selected storage. Default will be display all nomination with same cargo no with the selected storage </p>
