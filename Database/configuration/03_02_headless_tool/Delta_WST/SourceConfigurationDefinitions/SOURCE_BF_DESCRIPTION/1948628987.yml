  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Line Items Properties screen</strong>    defines and
    manages the connection from the SP (sales and purchases or financial transactions)
    module into the VO (quantity) module in terms of a quantity    placeholder, i.e.
    a VO Stream Item at which the hydrocarbon quantity related to this Transaction
    will be stored when the Document is set to BOOKED. The    system will also try
    to pick up quantities from the Stream Item when setting the Point of Sale Date
    for the Transaction.</p><p>    In addition, this BF defines all the Line Item
    Templates for each Transaction Template for each Document Setup within a particular
    Contract. When    processing the Contract and creating a Document with Transactions,
    each Transaction will have Line Items according to the Line Item Templates defined
    in    this BF.</p><p>    The Line Items are the elements that will hold the monetary
    values in an Invoice, Credit Note, etc.</p><p>    The system can handle a number
    of <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">different types of Line Item Templates</strong>,
    divided into two main categories:<br>    <strong><em>Hydrocarbon Quantity Based:</em></strong><br>    -
    Hydrocarbon Quantity X Unit Price = Value<br>    - The Price Elements of the Price
    Concept for the Transaction Template defines which Line Item Templates we will
    have: Each Price Element will be a Line    Item Template.<br>    <strong><em>Other
    Based:</em></strong><br>    - Free entity X Unit Price = Value<br>    - Interest:
    (Base Amount X Annual Rate X Number of Days) / Days in a Year = Value<br>    -
    Fixed Value: Just a fixed value<br>    - Any number of these can be freely added
    by the user</p><p>    The screen is divided into following sections:<br>       <strong><em>-
    Filter Navigator:</em></strong><br>    The Filter Navigator lists all the contracts
    being valid at the date selected in the Filter Navigator. By clicking a contract
    object in the Filter    Navigator all the documents defined for the contract will
    be listed in the Document List section.<br>    <strong><em>- Document List:</em></strong><br>    The
    Document List lists all the documents defined for the selected contract. By clicking
    a Document the Transaction Templates for the selected Document    will be listed
    in the Transaction Template List.<br>    <strong><em>- Transaction Template List:</em></strong><br>    This
    section lists all the Transaction Templates defined for the selected Contract
    / Document Setup.<br>    <strong><em>- Hydrocarbon Quantity Based Line Item Template
