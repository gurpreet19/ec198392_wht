  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The main intention with the Monthly Field Data business function is to provide a flexible and efficient screen for capturing monthly production data. Further, the screen provides a good overview for operators, monitoring all incoming data. The screen is suitable for both internal and external use, i.e. external parties can be given access to the screen, and key-in required data directly.</p>

    <p>The Production data section lists all streams conforming to the navigator selection. For each stream, some attributes are shown as read only, some are editable. Attributes in the screen can be disabled or new attributes can be enabled. In the above configuration the production quantities have flexible unit of measure, hence there is an accompanying unit column for each quantity column. The normal way of using this screen is to automatically instantiate records prior to the start of a new period. This way the users will experience that the screen always contains all relevant streams, but initially without values. By selecting one stream (row), the row will be highlighted and any underlying Attachments will be shown in the below section.</p>

    <p>It is possible to upload Attachments related to the data in this screen. The Attachments will be linked to Facility Class 1 (not to Stream). For uploading an Attachment, click the Upload button. A file browser dialogue box will then be presented for the user to select the file to be uploaded. The uploaded file is stored in the EC database as a BLOB (binary large object), and is immediately available for viewing by clicking the View button.</p>

    <p>The supported file upload formats can be configured by using the system property &quot;Monthly Stream Status Allowed File Extensions&quot; in Maintain System Settings (CO.1006). Allowed file extensions need to be listed as comma separated values (eg. .docx,.pdf). Setting the value .* will allow all file extensions to be uploaded. This is also the default value.</p>

    <p>Navigator selections are applied when pressing the [GO] &ndash;button.</p>
