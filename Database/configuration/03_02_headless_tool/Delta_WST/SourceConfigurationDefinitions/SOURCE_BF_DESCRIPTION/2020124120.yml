  DESCRIPTION: <p>The <strong>Report Definition</strong> business function is a part of the EC reporting system which provides functionality to create report definitions, schedule reports and administer generated reports. The purpose of the Report Definition business function is to:</p><ul><li>Specify values on parameters defined in the report template.</li><li>Group reports.</li></ul><p>To be able to create a report definition the user has to create a report template. The report definition will then be based on an existing template. Before creating a report template, users will need to create a version for the template. Each version is used to define different templates used for different period of time. The report definitions are used when generating the reports in the Report Administration screen, or scheduling the reports in the scheduler screen.</p><p>The table on the top lists all the report definitions where the user can use this table to create a hierarchy of definitions. This table will also be a master for the table below, which lists the report templates in the selected definition. The report area is for grouping report definition to ease the navigation in the Report Administration BF.&nbsp;Also, the report area can be used to add additional access rights to reports based on the report definition. The report area is based on an object class, so ringfencing will apply.&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom section populates all the parameters specified in the <em>Report Template </em>screen for the selected version. E.g., if a parameter in the Report Template screen is specified to be an EC class, a popup will be displayed in this screen so that the user can select the correct EC object. If the value of a parameter is not specified, the parameter will be populated when creating a <em>report </em>in the Report Administration BF. Parameters inside a report definition tree, with the same name and description, will appear as one parameter when creating a report .See the Report Administration BF for more details around this.</p><p>The report definitions can have a tree structure to be able to generate complex reports consisting of several other reports. Usually a report definition containing one or more report template is used so tree view of report definitions has been disabled by default.</p><p>The figure below shows an example of a tree view of report definitions.</p><p><img src="/onlinehelp/img?type=description&amp;bfDescNo=RP.0002&amp;imgNo=1&amp;dataLevel=0&amp;pfdrid_c=true" class="ecImg"></p><p>To avoid high complexity, it is recommended to keep the three <em>wide</em> and not configure it to have too many levels. Note that a report definition cannot have more than one parent. The "Sort Order" field on the Report Definition level determines the order between the definitions on the same level. E.g. the sort order on Definition B and C will not be affected of the order on Definition A, which is on the level above.</p>
