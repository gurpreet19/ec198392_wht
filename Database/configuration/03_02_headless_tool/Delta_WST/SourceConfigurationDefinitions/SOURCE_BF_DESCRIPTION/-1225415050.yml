  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to view different types of inventory and transactions on inventories for Contracts.</p><p>In a dispatching environment there can be several types of inventory for Contracts with transportation rights on a pipeline. A typical example of this is imbalance (or linepack). Imbalance is the difference between what is put into the pipeline by a shipper and what is taken out of it. Normally the pipeline will have rules if the shippers are allowed to have an imbalance and how big it can get. There may also be penalties if the imbalance gets too big.</p><p>In the navigator the user select a contract inventory.</p><p>The first tab shows a tabular view on the inventory level for each day in selected period in the navigator.</p><p>The second data section in the first tab list all transaction on the inventory for selected day. Transactions can be several types like trading or swapping of imbalance.</p><p>The second tab will show the same data as the first section in the first tab, but it will be displayed as a graph.</p><p>The third tab allows for input on target inventory. Both the first and the second tab includes the Target Qty to allow for comparison.</p><p>This business function allows the user to add inventory level manually for the day. This will in many cases be handled by other processes like Daily Delivery Calculations. If that is the case the user would typically not have access to change the data in this data section. For transaction it is also allowed to do insert, but that too may be coming from other parts of the system.</p>
