  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to list oil stream data for a Period (From &ndash; To Date) and for only one Stream. Data can be entered manually or automatically. The BF requires one entry per stream per day, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all oil streams that are part of a stream set for this screen. Thus, this BF has value instantiation for Day start where blank line for all measured oil streams will be inserted. A project can set up several instances of this screen by ensuring that correct stream data class and stream set list are passed as a parameter in the tree view.</p>
