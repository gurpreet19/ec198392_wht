  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Project Data Extract screen</strong>    is used to
    create Data Extract documents based on the Data Extract setup object and the Data
    Extract setup list configuration. The Data Extract document    will hold Data
    Entry data based on the configuration of the tags in the Data Extract Setup List
    screen. This screen is for Actuals. Accruals are created    and maintained in
    Project Data Extract Accrual screen (BF SP.0063).</p><p>By selecting a Data Extract
    setup object in the navigator the user get all the Data Extract documents created
    with this Data Extract in the table component    below. To create a new Data Extract
    the user must enter a Data Extract period (month) which corresponds with the Data
    Entry month the user wants to pick up    values for, and click on the <strong><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Create New Data Extract</span> button</strong>.</p><p>    If
    an Unverified or Unapproved Data Extract document for the same Data Extract setup
    and the same period already exists the user will get an error. Hence,    if it
    is Verified or Approved, the new Data Extract document will use the last verified
    or approved Data Extract document as its Previous Data Extract.    This way the
    user can have several revisions of one period and one Data Extract setup. The
    values of the previous Data Extract document will be visible in    the columns
    called Previous Amount/Qty.</p><p>    <strong style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Verify
    </strong>    <strong>and <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Un-verify</span>
    buttons</strong>    will change the data status. Verified or Approved data cannot
    be edited.<br>    - For Actual Data Extract documents the monetary and quantity
    values are never editable.<br>    - For Forecast Data Extract documents the values
    are editable if the Data Extract setup object is set up to be populated manually.</p><p>    <strong><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Trace Value</span> </strong>    <strong>button</strong>    will
    open a popup that will display all the values that went into producing the single
    number.</p>'
