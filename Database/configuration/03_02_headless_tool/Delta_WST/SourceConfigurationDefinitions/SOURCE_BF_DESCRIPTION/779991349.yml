  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This business function is used to define a comparison between two
    scenarios. The defined comparison can then be viewed in PP.0061:Forecast Scenarios
    Analysis</p><p>Each comparison will have to be assigned a unique code and it is
    linked to the last selected asset from the navigator (Production Unit, Facility,
    etc.). For eg: if Comparison 01 is created when the navigator is selected up to
    Production Unit, it will only be filtered when the navigator is until Production
    Unit. Each comparison involve two scenarios which may or may not belong to the
    same Forecast.</p><p>Each scenario can have an offset, given as a whole number
    of months. This means that it is possible to compare only parts of the scenarios,
    and/or compare data at different time periods. For example, using a period of
    January to March and a scenario 2 offset of -12 months would compare scenario
    1''s Q1 of the current year against scenario 2''s Q1 of the previous year.</p><p>The
    comparison can have different types and these types are configured as EC Codes.
    To configure the list of codes, go to EC Codes - All Screen -&gt; Select Code
    Type=''FCST_DEFINE_COMPARISON_TYPE'' -&gt; Configure Code as required.</p><p>The
    supported file upload formats can be configured by using the system property "Forecast
    Define Scenarios to Compare Allowed File Extensions" in Maintain System Settings
    (CO.1006). Allowed file extensions need to be listed as comma separated values
    (eg. .docx,.pdf). Setting the value .* will allow all file extensions to be uploaded.
    This is also the default value.</p><p><br></p>'
