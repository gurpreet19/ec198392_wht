  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The Integration Services captures data from external source systems (e.g. PI, OPC HDA, Oracle JDBC) and transfers it to the EC database for permanent storage. Configuration of data capture is done in mappings. A mapping defines which tag to be read and where to store the result, in addition to about 30 parameters to define which read method is to be used (if multiple are supported by the source system), which calculations are performed between the source system and EC, how to handle timestamps etc. Most of these parameters are identical in each mapping, or there may be identified groups of tags that use the same configuration.</p>

    <p>The Integration Services configuration screens make use of templates to define a set of configuration settings that constitute one read method. This way it is sufficient to select a mapping template for each mapping, and each parameter does not need to be set individually for each mapping. This simplifies the mapping process, and lowers the risk of errors.</p>

    <p>The Maintain Templates screen is used to define the available mapping templates.</p>
