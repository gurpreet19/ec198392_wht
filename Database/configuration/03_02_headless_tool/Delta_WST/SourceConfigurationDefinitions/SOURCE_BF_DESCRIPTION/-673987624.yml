  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen is used to view / maintain unloaded values for typically a Cost Insurance Freight (CIF) cargo.</p><p>In this business function, the navigator displays all cargos that are not Tentative and Official. When selecting a cargo, all nominations will be listed. For each<br />nomination, product measurements are instantiated, making it possible to enter unloaded values for different measurement types and units. One of the<br />measurement types is used as the nominated lifted value (nominated unit). Measurement types and units are configured for each product (export quality) in Product&nbsp;Measurement Setup (CO.2002).</p><p>The &lsquo;Expected Unload&rsquo; values are calculated on retrieved. How the value should be calculated must be defined by each individual implementation. It is<br />recommended that this function does not return any errors since this will prevent data from being loaded into the screen.</p><p>The &lsquo;Unload Value&rsquo; attribute will be editable if not set to calculated in Product Measurement Setup. To calculate the value use the &lsquo;Calculate&rsquo; button. How the<br />calculate values are calculated must be defined by each individual implementation in a Calculation Rule.</p>
