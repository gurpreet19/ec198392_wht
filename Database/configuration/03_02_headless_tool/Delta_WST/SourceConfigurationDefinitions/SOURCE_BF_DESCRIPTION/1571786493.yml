  DESCRIPTION: <p>When the carrier arrives, it is common that representatives from the terminal perform an inspection of the tanker and record some essential information prior to&nbsp;loading and after loading completed. Such information may be used if a claim situation could occur, and printed versions are typically part of the cargo document set&nbsp;provided.</p><p>To track this information, the Ship Info and Ullages business function allows the user to enter relevant information about the ship, like pilot, number of tugboats and&nbsp;draughts. Further, ullage information can be entered for each tank. Ullage is measured as distance between the actual level of the liquid and the top of the tank. The&nbsp;&lsquo;Product Figures&rsquo; table can store total values (e.g. loaded quantity in multiple UoMs etc.), these figures are normally used to compare shore lifting figures with ship&nbsp;lifting figures for verification purposes.</p>
