  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The Forecast Manager consists of tabs of existing and new Cargo
    Planning screens to satisfy all business needs for cargo planning. The top section
    is the Cargo Planning Forecast section where all forecasts are listed here. This
    forecast list can be filtered by date, storage and forecast period. The End Date
    next to &quot;Create&quot; button is optional.<p><b><u>Create button:</u></b><br>To
    create a new forecast from the original data, click the &quot;Create&quot; button.
    The original data within the date range of navigator date (start date) and End
    Date field will be copied to the new forecast. If end date is not entered, by
    default the period of the original data to be copied to a new forecast will be
    based on the forecast period selected in the navigator :<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>For
    a short term forecast, one month of original data will be copied.</li> <li>For
    a medium term forecast, three months of original data will be copied.</li> <li>For
    a long term forecast one year of original data will be copied</li><p>The Forecast
    Status will be set to &quot;New&quot;, and Forecast Type will be set to &quot;Draft&quot;.
    If storage is selected in the popup, the original data of that storage will only
    be copied to the new forecast.<p><b><u>Copy button:</u></b><br>To create a new
    forecast from an existing forecast, click the &quot;Copy&quot; button. The data
    of an existing forecast, based on the navigator date, end date and the storage
    selected in the popup (if any), will be copied to the new forecast. This means
    that if there is no overlap between the start date and end date of the two forecasts,
    no data will be copied. Same applies if storage selected in the popup is not the
    same as the storage of the existing forecast.<p><b><u>Apply button:</u></b><br>To
    copy the forecast data back to the original dataset, click the &quot;Apply&quot;
    button. Existing original dataset will be overridden and potentially deleted.
    A confirmation message before copying forecast to original can be configure in
    Maintain System Settings.<p><b><u>Delete button:</u></b><br>Click this button
    will delete the selected forecast in the forecast list, together with its child
    records.<p><b><u>Overview Tab:</u></b><br>The first data section is the Forecast
    Storage KPI Monitoring. It shows the key performance indicator of the storage
    level for the selected storage.<p>The second data section is the Forecast Contract
    KPI Monitoring, which is used to validate the different ADP scenarios/forecasts
    against contractual commitments before promoting one of the forecasts to original.
    Key performance indicators in this context typically include Annual Contractual
    Quantity (ACQ) or Adjusted Annual Contractual Quantity (AACQ) versus delivered/planned
    quantity from actual deliveries and the annual delivery Plan (ADP).<p>Contractually
    SPAs will often have an associated tolerance limit and this limit can be used
    as a basis for monitoring the contract KPIs in this business function. SPA performance
    that falls outside of the tolerance limit can be identified and proper action
    taken to ensure SPA commitments are fulfilled.<p><b><u>Calculate Tab:</u></b><br>This
    business function is used to start the generation of a lifting program for a forecast.<p>A
    Lifting Program is the generation of nominations against a given storage (a set
    of tanks containing the same product) over a period. The idea is to generate nominations
    in such a way that the storage level is kept between the operational limits specified
    for the storage. What Lifting Account to associate to the nomination will be based
    on business rules. These business rules are decided by the take-up project/customer
    and are typically based on contractual agreements.<p>The navigator is a group
    model navigator. The calculation job must be selected in the navigator.<p>Once
    a calculation run has been made, the details are displayed in new rows on the
    screen, one for each run, along with the outcome (e.g. Success of Failure). By
    highlighting a row from the upper section of the screen, i.e. an individual calculation
    run, the associated log file summary from that run is displayed in the lower section
    of the screen and the user can press the Download button to examine the full log
    file.<p>The Calculation Job makes it possible to decide how the calculations will
    be performed, if several jobs exist then they will run the calculations with different
    input parameters. These input parameters can be used by the calculation rules
    to decide which equations to execute.<p>The Delete button will delete all nominations
    within the selected period that is not flagged as fixed or is connected to a cargo
    that is Official and Ready for Harbour. It is the Nominated Date that needs to
    be within the period in the navigator.<p>The calculation rule that is part of
    the product is a very simple entitlement based lifting program. There are a few
    input parameters, but it will basically create a nomination whenever the threshold
    quantity is exceeded and assign it to the Lifting Account that has the highest
    availability. The size of the lifting is set on the Storage. If this is null an
    error is returned.<p><b><u>Schedule Tab:</u></b><br>The first data section in
    this tab displays a JSF graphical presentation on the storage level over a forecast
    period. The navigator consists of a group model navigator, Lifting Account navigator
    and a Sub Daily Data checkbox where both is optional.<br>The max level and min
    level shows the levels of the selected storage and its tanks. The storage level
    is normally calculated based on the planned/official production deducting planned/official
    nominations.<p>There is a &quot;Open Entitlement Details&quot; button under the
    schedule lifting chart section. Clicking this button will display the daily entitlements
    of the selected forecast in the forecast list.<p>The second data section will
    display a Berth Utilisation Gantt Chart. The berth utilisation gantt chart shows
    the loading of the berth on a particular date range. If lifting account is selected
    in the navigator, the berth will be filtered by the selected lifting account.
    The berth slot gantt chart will show the status (tooltip) on mouseover when the
    berth slot is available, occupied (Green), or conflict (Red) for a cargo nomination.
    The chart column can be dragged to adjust the nominated date of a cargo nomination.
    If save the adjustment will be reflected in the nomination table.<p>If the Sub
    Daily Data checkbox is selected, the schedule lifting chart and the berth utilisation
    gantt chart will display a sub daily chart respectively.<p>The third data section
    is a nomination table displaying nominations based on the date, storage, lifting
    account selected in the navigator. When the nominated quantity/date is updated
    the associated account transaction is updated, any changes done to nominated date
    and/or nominated quantity will be reflected in the Schedule Lifting Chart and
    Berth Utilisation Chart. It is possible to insert a new nomination in the Nomination
    table.<p>The &quot;View Cargo Details&quot; button under the nomination section
    when clicked will display a popup with more information of the selected cargo,
    and any additional information of the cargo can be added in this popup. After
    updating the cargo information click the &quot;Refresh&quot; button to see the
    new changes reflected in this section.<p>The fourth data section is the period
    operational restriction table. It displays the planned maintenance for restriction
    objects such as berth and pipeline. These objects must implement the OPERATIONAL_RESTRICTION
    interface. It is possible to insert a new restriction in the fourth data section.<p><b><u>Calendar
    Tab:</u></b><br>This tab will show a yearly overview of available berth slots
    for cargoes.<p>A berth slot could be unavailable, for instance, due to the following
    reason :<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>Unloading of cargoes</li> <li>Maintenance
    is planned on that day</li><li>A cargo is planned while berth slot is unavailable
    due to maintenance</li><li>A cargo is overlapping another cargo</li><p>The tab
    will display this information based on the month, berth, lifting account selected
    in the navigator. The berth navigator and lifting account navigator is optional.
    If a berth or lifting account are selected in the navigator berth availability
    will be filtered accordingly.<p>Mouse over a highlighted day in the calendar will
    show tooltip text of the berth name, cargoes and the status of the berth slot
    which is either occupied or in conflict (overlapping of cargoes) or unassigned
    (Berth not assigned). Days highlighted in red color indicates conflict status,
    yellow color indicates unassigned status and green color indicates occupied status.<p>The
    availability of the berth slots and tooltip text can be implemented by the project
    through a function getCalendarDetail, getCalendarTooltipFcstManager respectively
    in the ue_stor_fcst_lift_nom package.<p>The EC Code CARGO_CALENDAR_DETAIL is used
    to lookup the detail code of an unavailable berth slots, the color which will
    be used for highlighting unavailable berth slots.<p>The function getCalendarDetail
    in the product will only check for existing cargoes. The project will need to
    implement any planned maintenance in the function (if applicable). <p><b><u>Documents
    Tab:</u></b><br>The tab will be used to upload documents for the selected forecast.
    The supported file upload formats can be configured by using the system property
    &quot;Forecast Manager Allowed File Extensions&quot; in Maintain System Settings
    (CO.1006). Allowed file extensions need to be listed as comma separated values
    (eg. .docx,.pdf). Setting the value .* will allow all file extensions to be uploaded.
    This is also the default value. Click &quot;Select File&quot; button to browse
    for the document to be uploaded. Click &quot;Attach File&quot; after the document
    is selected and this file will be uploaded to EC. Click &quot;Cancel&quot; button
    will cancel the document upload. Click &quot;View Attachment&quot; button will
    give option to open or save the document in local drive. <p><b><u>Compare Tab:</u></b><br>The
    first section is the Schedule Lifting chart, displaying and comparing the new
    forecast storage level against the existing forecast storage level, or with the
    original storage level. When mouse over the storage level there will be tooltip
    showing basic information about the storage level quantity. It will also display
    flags that shows the forecast cargo and actual cargo.<p>The second section is
    where the user could either compare original or forecast cargo against the new
    forecast selected in the forecast list. If the Cargo Planning Forecast navigator
    is blank, the original cargo will be used for comparing with new forecast cargo.<br>The
    validation rule of comparing the differences between cargos of this data section
    will be implemented by project. The data on the left is the data of the selected
    forecast in the forecast list whereas the data on the right is the original data
    or other existing data. If the new forecast cargo data is required to rollback,
    user can select the Undo checkbox, click Undo button and the data in the new forecast
    will be rollback to the original values or existing forecast values. Undo functionality
    will be implemented by project.<p><b><u>Opportunities Tab:</u></b><br>This tab
    will contain a list of opportunities that can be included into the forecast selected
    in the top section. Multi select will be supported. (These opportunities are basically
    created and maintained in &quot;Maintain Opportunities&quot; screen)The user can
    then simply check relevant Opportunities that are to be evaluated physically and
    contractually in a forecast, and then press the &quot;INCLUDE IN FORECAST&quot;
    button.<p>The affect of the included Opportunities can then be evaluated in Forecast
    Manager->Schedule tab &quot;Berth Gantt Chart&quot;.<p>When opportunity is included
    in Forecast, the Nominated Qty of specified cargo (which is specified in &quot;Maintain
    Opportunities&quot; screen) is updated with Qty from Maintain Opportunities->General
    Terms tab.<p>The visualization of the Opportunity inside &quot;Berth Gantt Chart&quot;
    will be implemented by project.<p>After evaluation and visualization of opportunity
    in Gantt chart,If deemed beneficial the opportunity can then be confirmed and
    the forecast promoted to official and copied to the base plan.<p>The &quot;Confirm&quot;
    button will change the status of the selected Opportunity to &quot;Confirmed&quot;.<p>When
    the opportunity is confirmed the color coding in the Gantt chart can then be configured
    to change back to the standard green color.<p><b><u>Carrier Utilisation Tab:</u></b><br>The
    Carrier Utilisation tab displays an overview of how a carrier will be utilised
    in a forecast year.<p>The first data section shows a Carrier Utilisation Chart.
    This carrier utilisation chart can be filtered by date, product group and carrier
    navigator. It will show the unavailable reason for a carrier, cargo name, carrier
    name, arrival port, destination port, nominated quantity and the daytime as tooltip
    when mouse over the bars (which represents a cargo). The carrier availability
    status by default is available in product: Loading, En Route, Unloading and Return.
    The colour of the bars in the Gantt chart can be customized from CO.0068 - EC
    Codes. The carrier status will show conflict (red) for a cargo with exact start
    of lifting with same carrier. The bars in the chart can be dragged horizontally
    to adjust the lifting date of a cargo nomination. If save the adjustment will
    be reflected in the nomination table in Schedule tab. Round trip time/Route days
    is configurable from Carrier Port Acceptance (CO.2064) screen.<p>Cargoes can be
    dragged vertically between different carriers and where a carrier is available.
    Planned maintenance for restriction objects i.e. carrier can be added from Schedule
    Tab (Period Operational Restriction) section . Carrier objects must implement
    the OPERATIONAL_RESTRICTION interface.<p>The second data section displays the
    carrier usage for a given forecast period in percentage, i.e, total time used
    for cargo deliveries/ enroute time + maintenance time.<p><b><u>Details Tab:</u></b><br>This
    tab displays the details of the forecast selected in the Forecast list: Cargo
    Planning Forecast Code, Cargo Planning Forecast Name, Storage, Forecast Period,
    Forecast Status, Forecast Type. These information will be populated after creating
    a new forecast (after select &quot;Create&quot; button). However it is still possible
    to update these information in this tab.'
