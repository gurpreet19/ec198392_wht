  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The Validation Overview screen displays an aggregated view of executed
    Check Rule validations. The first section lists all Check Rule groups, with “–––&gt;”
    indents indicating level for the given group (sub–group, sub–sub–group, etc).
    The status and summary of all Check Rule subgroups are aggregated up to the level
    above.</p><p>This list is filtered by time period (From date / To date) and Group.
    The Group dropdown is populated with all groups that include subgroups, and when
    it is selected the list will display the selected group and all its children.  Highlighting
    a group in the list will display all the Check Rule error log entries connected
    to this group and its descendant groups. The "Run Selected Groups" button will
    rerun all selected rules that have generated error log entries. If updating the
    Ignore flag and pressing the Save Log button, the flagged error log entries will
    be ignored when creating error/warning icons in the tree view.</p><p>Note that
    in this version the Validation Overview screen requires a root group parameter
    as an input parameter for the screen to function properly. So when the screen
    is defined it must include a query string containing a ROOT_GROUP parameter with
    a valid Check Rule Group. For example: <em>../com.ec.frmw.co.screens/validation_overview?ROOT_GROUP=D_EXPORT</em></p><p>The
    purpose of this is to enable several Validation Overview screens with different
    access for given users/roles.</p>'
