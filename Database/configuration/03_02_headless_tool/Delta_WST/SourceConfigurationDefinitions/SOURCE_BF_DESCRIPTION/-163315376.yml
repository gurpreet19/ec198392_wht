  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to run the daily sales calculations. This is basically the same as Daily Contract Calculation (SA.0001), but with a main difference.&nbsp;<span style=""line-height:1.6"">Instead of running the same calculation for selected contracts, this BF will look up what calculation to run for the individual contracts.</span></p><p>On the Contract object there is an attribute &lsquo;Daily Contract Calculation&rsquo; that will hold the information about what calculation should be run for this contract. If this&nbsp;value is empty the contract is ignored. If the calculation fails for one contract the rest of the calculations will not be executed.</p><p>The order on how the contract are run when part of Contract Groups is defined by the &lsquo;Calculation Sequence&rsquo; attribute on Contract.</p>
