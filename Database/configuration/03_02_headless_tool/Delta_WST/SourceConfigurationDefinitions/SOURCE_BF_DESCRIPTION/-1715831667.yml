  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen is used for monitoring of contract deliveries / plan (Annual Delivery Plan) for any given delivery program year. Within the oil and gas business and&nbsp;especially within the LNG domain it is critical to at any time be able to track and report on how the plant is performing with regards to its contractual commitments.&nbsp;Long term contracts are typically monitored on a 12 month basis where the start of the contract year is not always January 1st.<br />&nbsp;</p>
