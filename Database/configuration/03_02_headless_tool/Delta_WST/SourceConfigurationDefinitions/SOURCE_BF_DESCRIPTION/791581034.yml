  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p>This screen is used to connect object class to other object class objects. The screen opens to model many to many dependencies between different object classes. Examples: Wells can be linked to compressors, where one well can belong to many compressors and one compressor can have many wells. These object classes should be all object classes that have facility_class_1 and facility_class_2 as parent (e.g. well, stream, tank, equipments ++).</p>

    <p>The connections have a start and end date, where end date is exclusive.</p>

    <p>The second operational navigator is used to control which object classes and objects that are listed in popup&rsquo;s. <strong>Do not </strong>use it to limit the records being displayed.</p>

    <p>&lsquo;Swing Well&rsquo; connection is supported when Well is selected in the Object Class dropdown on the navigator. Wells can only be connected to Facility Class 1, Node and Well Hookup using the &lsquo;Swing Well&rsquo; connection.</
