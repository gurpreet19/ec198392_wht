  DESCRIPTION: '<p>During a lift operation, it is essential that a &ldquo;time sheet&rdquo;
    or &ldquo;port log&rdquo; is prepared, recording all defined activities required
    during the lifting operation. In Energy<br />Components, activities are defined
    in the Lifting Activity Code (CO.2005) configuration screen. Product specific
    activities are defined in Product Lifting Activity Code&nbsp;(CO.20014).</p><p>Activities
    are either periodical activity with a start-date and end-date, or instance activities
    with only one daytime (only start-date). Based on information in this&nbsp;business
    function, a printed time sheet can be produced. This will typically form part
    of the official cargo documentation to be prepared for each cargo.</p><p>Whenever
    a Cargo is set to Official and Ready for Loading, a set of lifting activities
    is instantiated. This means that an activity is created for each lifting activity
    code&nbsp;marked as &ldquo;Is Instantiated&rdquo; or has a value in &ldquo;Demurrage
    Code&rdquo; in the Lifting Activity Code configuration screen. If required, additional
    activities can be entered. An&nbsp;activity code can only be registered once for
    a given cargo.</p><p>For more information on Cargo Status see Cargo Status Rules.</p><p>Context
    menu can be enabled on the first data section of the screen to execute the oracle
    procedure: ue_cargo_action.</p><p>Sample of setting up context menu for the screen,
