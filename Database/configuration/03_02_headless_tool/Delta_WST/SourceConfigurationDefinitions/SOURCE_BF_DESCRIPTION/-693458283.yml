  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Contractual Attributes screen</strong> is used to change
    the contract attributes.</p><p>Each contract has a Contract Template (BF CO.2020)
    where the attributes are defined. Depending on the template, different attributes
    can therefore be listed in this screen.</p><p>The screen is divided into these
    sections:</p> <p> <strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Navigator</strong></p><p>This
    is where a Contract is selected.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Attributes
    Section</strong></p><p>This is a section where all the attributes and current
    values for the selected Contract are listed.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0,
    102, 204);">Attribute Version Section</strong></p><p>This is where all versions
    of the selected attribute in the previous section are listed. <br> If the attribute
    is retrieved from a user exit function this section will be empty because there
    are no versions of the attribute.</p> <p>More information can be found at Transport
    Contract Attributes screen (BF CO.2021).</p>'
