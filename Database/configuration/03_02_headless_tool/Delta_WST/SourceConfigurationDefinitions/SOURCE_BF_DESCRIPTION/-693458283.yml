  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Contractual Attributes screen</strong>    is used to
    change the contract attributes.</p><p>    Each contract has a Contract Template
    (CO.2020) where the attributes are    defined. Depending on the template, different
    attributes can therefore be    listed in this screen.</p><p>    <u>The screen
    is divided into these sections:</u></p><p>    <em><strong>- Filter Navigator:</strong></em>    where
    a Contract is selected.</p><p>    <em><strong>- Attributes Section: </strong></em>    where
    all the attributes and current values for the selected Contract are    listed.</p><p>    <em><strong>-
    Attribute Version Section: </strong></em>    where all versions of the selected
    attribute in the previous section are    listed.    <br/>    If the attribute
    is retrieved from a user exit function this section will    be empty because there
    are no versions of the attribute.</p><p>    More information can be found at Transport
    Contract Attributes screen (BF    CO.2021).</p>'
