  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The Calculation Context screen is used to define calculation contexts. A calculation context is a grouping mechanism that doesn&rsquo;t contain any useful information in itself, but is rather used to group various calculation configuration elements depending on calculation type.</p>

    <p>The calculation engine in EC is used for many different types of calculations, that can differ greatly in complexity, business area and which data etc are used.</p>

    <p>Calculations and related configuration is therefore defined per calculation context. This makes sure that configuration that is only relevant for one business area is only visible when working with that area. The main benefit of this is that users will not be confused by configuration that is not relevant for them.</p>

    <p>Although it is possible to add, modify and even delete calculation contexts from this screen, caution is advised as the EC product does have some hard&ndash;codings against calculation context codes:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Deleting or changing the Code attribute of a calculation context will cause any screens that normally run calculations from that context to stop working, as these screens will have a hard&ndash;coded reference to this context code.</li>
    <li>If a new context is added then this will not be usable from any of the normal calculation run screens. It should, however, be possible to run such calculations through the EC Scheduler.</li>
    <li>Even though it is an object class, we do not recommend adding new versions of a Calculation Context object as this is not intended and has not been tested.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
