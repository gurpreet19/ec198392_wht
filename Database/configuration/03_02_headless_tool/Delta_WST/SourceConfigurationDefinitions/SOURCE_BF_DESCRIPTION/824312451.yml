  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to record any renomination against a contract &quot;within day&quot;. If changes to nominations are made before the start of the gas day, those details should be recorded in EC by changing the existing nomination originally entered in daily nomination (SD.0002).</p><p>Renomination is allowed at any time within the gas day even though it is back in time. The data entered is the time of the renomination and the new daily quantity. Note that when a renomination occurs, the assumption is that a proportion of the original nomination (and/or any previous renominations) has already been delivered. The new daily nomination quantity therefore pertains only to the proportion of the gas day remaining after the time of its entry. In order to calculate the actual, new daily quantity that is used to define the overall nomination for that day, it is necessary to perform a calculation as follows.</p><p>The total nominated volume for any gas day will be calculated by multiplying the nominated rates which have been in force that day (both from the original nomination and considering any previous renominations for the day) by the fraction of the day for which they were valid (fraction of a day is measured in minutes).</br>For example, if the nomination for a day was 10000 Sm3/d and an renomination was made effective at 12:00 for a rate of 5000 Sm3/d and the gas day starts at 00:00, then the Adjusted Daily Quantity would be ((10000 * (720 / 1440)) + (5000 * (720 / 1440))) = 7500 Sm.</br>For a second renomination of 12000 Sm3 at 17:30, the Adjusted Daily Quantity would be ((10000 * (720 / 1440)) + (5000 * (330 / 1440)) + (12000 * (390 / 1440))) = 9395.83 Sm3.</p><p>The screen supports multiple renominations for any gas day. The user chooses a day and a list of any existing renominations is displayed (in descending time order - i.e. latest first).</p><p>If an original nomination does not exist the adjusted daily quantity cannot be calculated. The user must enter a nomination in the daily nomination (SD.0002) to get a value. A nomination of 0 must be entered if no nomination existed prior to the new nomination.</p><p>Note that the list of renominations will contain data for the gas day. If the gas day starts at 06:00 a renomination entered 04:00 the same day will not be listed. A renomination at 02:00 the day after will be listed since in the same gas day.</p>
