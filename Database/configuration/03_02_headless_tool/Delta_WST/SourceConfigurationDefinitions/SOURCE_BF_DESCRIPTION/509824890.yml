  DESCRIPTION: <p>The main purpose of this business function is for the transportation service provider to view the result from the confirmation process and the scheduling process.</p><p>The transportation service provider would typically use this screen after nominations have been confirmed to verify each shipper&rsquo;s gas receipt and delivery schedule.&nbsp;Running the scheduling process is one in Daily Dispatching Calculations (GD.0044). The result from the calculation can be seen here.</p><p>The transportation service provider can select shippers from the first data section and view the total balance for the selected shipper&rsquo;s contracts. Selecting a&nbsp;contract will then in turn show the individual input and output nominations on that contract.</p><p>Specific implementations like color coding can be used to indicate to the gas scheduler that the system has detected situations that the gas scheduler needs to be&nbsp;aware of.</p>
