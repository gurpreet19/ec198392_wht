  DESCRIPTION: '<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Large systems may have a lot of reports that
    would require a lot of work if every single report had to be processed separately.
    The Report Set Administration screen gives the user the possibility to configure
    sets of reports, and to perform batch processes on these sets, like generation
    and distribution. The reports included in a set will here be called a <em>Report
    Set</em>.</p><p>The screen has a list of Report Sets and two tabs, Configure and
    Generate. In the <em>Configure</em>&nbsp;tab, reports for the selected report
    set&nbsp;can be configured.&nbsp;In the <em>Generation</em>&nbsp;tab the selected
    report set can be&nbsp;generated and further actions can be executed on the generated
    reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Report Sets can be created or deleted using the insert/delete
    icons.</p><h2>Configuration&nbsp;Tab</h2><p>Reports can be added to or removed&nbsp;from
    the selected Report Set&nbsp;using the insert/delete icons. For each report it
    is possible to provide individual parameter values. The values provided in <em>Report
    Administration</em> screen will not be used by the report set functionality.&nbsp;Only
    parameters that does not have a value provided in Report Definition will be available
    here. Values provided in Report Definition cannot be changed here.</p><p>If a
    user does not have access to any of the reports included in a report set, the
    report set will not be visible to that user.&nbsp;</p><p>NOTE: In versions prior
    to&nbsp;EC 11.1-SP03 it was not possible to provide different values for individual
    reports in the set, so it was common to create multiple report definitions and
    multiple reports to be able to have different values for a report parameter in
    a report set. Now a better approach is to create one&nbsp;report definition and
    one report, and then include the same report multiple times in a report set, and
    provide different values for a report parameter.</p><h2>Generation&nbsp;Tab</h2><p>In
    this tab, generation and further processing of the generated reports is done.
    There are five sections here, described below.&nbsp;</p><h3>Report Set Parameters</h3><p>The
    list of report parameters will include parameters from each of the reports in
    the set. Report parameters from different reports, with the same parameter name,
    will appear once in this list. The values provided here will not be used for reports
    that have a value set individually (in the Configuration tab).&nbsp;</p><h3>Generation</h3><p>The
    report set can be generated by clicking the <em>Generate </em>button. If <em>Job
    Start Time </em>is empty, the batch job will be executed immediately. Otherwise,
    if <em>a Job Start Time </em>is specified, the batch job will be scheduled to
    run at that time. Scheduled jobs will appear in the list of report set generations
    with status "Scheduled".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Log Level determines the log level
    for the scheduled job.&nbsp;</p><p>When the system generates each of the reports,
    a value for each of the report parameters is found given the following priority:</p><ol><li>Report
    Definition</li><li>Value provided for the specific report for the report set (in
    the Report Set List tab)</li><li>Common value provided for the report set (in
    the Report Set tab)</li></ol><p>If SEND_MSG is checked, the reports will be distributed
    using the EC Message Handling Management system. This requires that a link between
    the Report and a distribution list has been created. This is the same as clicking
    the "Send" button, but is done automatically when each individual report is generated
    successfully.&nbsp;</p><p>If PRINTER has specified a valid network printer, the
    job will send the generated reports to this printer.&nbsp;</p><h3>Report Set Generations</h3><p>Each
    time the report set is generated, a new row will be added to the Report Set Generation
    list. The list will give the overall status for the generation&nbsp;of the report
    sets (NEW or GENERATED). The buttons <em>Download, Verify All, Approve All and&nbsp;Send</em>&nbsp;will
    involve all reports for the generated report set. By selecting a report set generation,
    the Generated Reports will show up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a report set generation
    is deleted, all connected reports will also be deleted.&nbsp;</p><p>Reports generated
    for a report set will also be visible in the Report Administration screen.</p><h3>Generated
    Reports</h3><p>The generated reports for the selected report set generation will
    be shown here. Additional processing of each of these generated reports can be
    done here, just like in the Report Administration screen (View and Send).</p><p>Any
    error messages and the scheduler log can be found by clicking on the popup icon
    on the Log column for generated reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the list of generated
    reports, a section giving the report parameter values and send log is&nbsp;provided.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'
