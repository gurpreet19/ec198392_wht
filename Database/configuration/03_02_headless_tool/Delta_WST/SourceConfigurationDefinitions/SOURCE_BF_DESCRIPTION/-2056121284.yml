  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This BF manages the Quantity Forecast Cases in terms of quantities.
    In addition, this BF manages comments attached to each Field taking part in a
    Quantity Forecast Case.&nbsp; </p><p>The Quantity Forecast Case quantities can
    either be manually entered into the Quantity Forecast Case using this BF or uploaded
    through a flat file interface. Upload of Quantity Forecast Case quantities can
    be done using a scheduler job designed for this. A typical scenario is to start
    by uploading or entering the quantities for a Quantity Forecast Case having POPULATE_METHOD
    set to ?PLAN?. The next step is to make copy of this Quantity Forecast Case and
    change the POPULATE_METHOD to ?YEAR_TO_MONTH? to create a Closing Forecast (CF)
    for January. The MONTH attribute for the January CF will then be changed to January
    and the new Quantity Forecast Case can be updated with Final/Accrual quantities
    from the EC Revenue Quantities module for January using the ?Populate Forecast
    Case? function in BF ?FC.1001 ? Quantity Forecast Properties?. The Closing Forecast
    for February will then be created by making a copy of the January CF and changing
    the MONTH attribute to February.&nbsp; The February CF can then be updated with
    actual quantities from the EC Revenue Quantities module using the ?Populate Forecast
    Case? function.</p><p>The BF consists of these screen sections:</p><p>?&nbsp;Static
    Navigator</p><p>The following query elements are available for selecting a Quantity
    Forecast Case and determining which parts of the Quantity Forecast Case to view:</p><p>o&nbsp;Year:
    By selecting a Year the Forecast Case popup will be limited to only show Quantity
    Forecast Cases for that year.</p><p>o&nbsp;Forecast Case: This popup will list
    all the Quantity Forecast Cases for the selected Year available to the current
    user, i.e. all PUBLIC cases independent from which user originally created it,
    and all PRIVATE cases belonging to the current user.</p><p>o&nbsp;Company: From
    this selector the user can select to view COMPANY specific quantity values vs.
    FULL values. By selecting a particular COMPANY the quantity sections in this BF
    will only show Stream Items having the COMPANY attribute set to the selected COMPANY.
    By selecting ?FULL? the quantity sections in this BF will only show Stream Items
    having the COMPANY attribute set to FULL. This way it is possible to either view/modify
    company specific quantities or full (100%) quantities. The popup will only list
    Companies having the SYSTEM_COMPANY flag set to Yes (Y) in addition to the FULL
    company.</p><p>o&nbsp;Field Group: By selecting a Field Group only Stream Items
    having the FIELD attribute set to one of the Fields belonging to the selected
    Field Group will be listed in the Quantity Overview Section. This way users having
    responsibility for a limited number of Fields can view the relevant fields.</p><p>o&nbsp;The
    ?Go? button will execute the query and view the quantity details for the selected
    Quantity Forecast Case in the following sections.</p><p>?&nbsp;Quantity Overview
    Section</p><p>This section lists the Stream Items defined for the Quantity Forecast
    Case filtered by the selection criteria set by the Static Navigator. It is a table
    sorted vertically by Field Name. The columns are the Product Objects defined for
    the Quantity Forecast Case, sorted horizontally according to the Product Object
    Sort order. The Stream Item values are each summed across the year, i.e. it is
    the sum of the monthly numbers for each Stream Item. A Subtotal is calculated
    in the screen adding all the Stream Items together per Product Object. The Adjustment
    Stream Item is NOT part of the subtotal. The Adjustment Stream Item is a sum of
    the Adjustment Stream Item for each Field. This value is also calculated in the
    screen, i.e. the number is NOT stored in the database. The Field subtotal and
    the Adjustment sum is then added to get a Quantity Forecast Case Total for each
    Product Object. The Quantity Forecast Case Total is calculated on the fly and
    NOT stored in the database.</p><p>For each row there is also a column for SUM
    across the Product Objects for each Field calculated in BOE. The SUM quantity
    is also calculated to BOE/Day. <br>These values are not stored in the database
    ? they are calculated on the fly.</p><p>This section has a ?POPULATE FORECAST
    CASE? button for updating Stream Item values with actual data from the EC Revenue
    Quantities module, table STIM_MTH_ACTUAL. This button will also update any of
    the Adjustment Stream Items.</p><p>This section has a button for setting the entire
    Quantity Forecast Case to APPROVED. The ?APPROVE? button will only be accessible
    by users having the access rights set accordingly, i.e. access rights to change
    record status from PROVISIONAL / VERIFIED to APPROVED.</p><p>This section also
    has a button for resetting a Quantity Forecast Case from APPROVED back to PROVISIONAL.
    When performing this action the system must check that if the Quantity Forecast
    Case in question is in use by a Revenue Forecast Case, the Revenue Forecast Case
    MUST NOT have status APPROVED, i.e. it is not allowed to reset a Quantity Forecast
    Case to PROVISIONAL if the corresponding Revenue Forecast Case is set to APPROVED.
    Similarly it will not be allowed to set a Revenue Forecast Case to APPROVED unless
    the corresponding Quantity Forecast Case has been set to APPROVED first.</p><p>This
    section will handle cases where there are no stream items for a given combination
    of Field and Product Object, i.e. a pure Gas Field will not have any Crude Stream
    Items. For these cases the table will simply have no quantity for the given Field
    / Product Object. This section will have NULL-handling in order to ensure correct
    sub-totals, grand totals, sum in BOE, and sum in BOE/day in case of ?missing?
    stream items.</p><p>All values are read only in this section, regardless of record
    status or access privileges. </p><p>?&nbsp;Field/Month Quantity Section</p><p>This
    section lists the Stream Items for the Field selected in the Quantity Overview
    section in combination with the other query parameters set in the Static Navigator,
    i.e. only Stream Items matching selected Field in the Quantity Overview section
    together with the Company selection for the selected Quantity Forecast Case. This
    section will have one row for each month of the year.</p><p>Each row will be read
    only or editable depending on the POPULATE_METHOD of the Quantity Forecast Case
    and the Row Status for each row. </p><p>The Row Status is calculated as follows
    for Quantity Forecast Cases having POPULATE_METHOD set to ?YEAR_TO_MONTH?: <br>o&nbsp;If
    ALL Stream Items for a particular month is set to FINAL, then the Status is set
    to FINAL and the row is read only. A Stream Item will have its Status set when
    updating the Quantity Forecast Case with actual numbers from the Quantity module.
    The Status will then be set to the same value as the Stream Item has in the Actual
    table (STIM_MTH_ACTUAL)<br>o&nbsp;If ONE of the Stream Items for a particular
    month is set to ACCRUAL, then the Row Status is set to ACCRUAL and the row is
    read only. A Stream Item will have its Status set when updating the Quantity Forecast
    Case with actual numbers from the Quantity module. The Status will then be set
    to the same value as the Stream Item has in the Actual table (STIM_MTH_ACTUAL)<br>o&nbsp;If
    none of the criteria above is fulfilled, the Row Status is set to PLAN and the
    row is editable given the user has the access rights with respect to modifying
    PROVISIONAL / VERIFIED / APPROVED data elements.</p><p>For Quantity Forecast Cases
    having POPULATE_METHOD set to ?PLAN? all rows will be editable given the user
    has the access rights with respect to modifying PROVISIONAL / VERIFIED / APPROVED
    data elements</p><p>A Year Total per Product Object for the selected Field is
    calculated by the screen and not stored in the database. The Year Total quantity
    is read only. </p><p>This section also provides a read-only field for showing
    the Adjustment Stream Item quantities. These quantities are entered using the
    VO screens and will be copied to the Quantity Forecast Case as part of the ?Populate
    Forecast Case? method in BF ?FC.1001 ? Quantity Forecast Properties?. These quantities
    are stored as a monthly number at the first month of the Quantity Forecast Case,
    i.e. January.</p><p>A Grand Total per Product Object for the selected Field is
    calculated by the screen and not stored in the database. The Grand Total is the
    sum of the Year Total and the Adjustment per Product Object. </p><p>For each row
    there is also a column for SUM across the Product Objects for each Month calculated
    in BOE. The SUM quantity is also calculated to BOE/Day according to the number
    of days for each month. The number of days in February will be 29 for leap years.
    These values are not stored in the database ? they are calculated on the fly.</p><p>The
    Stream Items connected to a Quantity Forecast Case may not be valid for all the
    months through the year. If this is the case for a Stream Item, the data element
    for the combination of Product Object and Month will be NULL and read only.</p><p>When
    entering or modifying quantities in this section the Cascade logic will be executed
    in order to update any other Stream Items being part of the Quantity Forecast
    Case which has a Formula or Split Key reference to the Stream Item in question.</p><p>Stream
    Items defined for the selected Quantity Forecast Case and Field which has no value
    set, i.e. the Stream Item value is NULL, will be marked in red to make it easier
    to identify missing quantity data. To change this, the user can press on the ?Populate
    Forecast Case? button above to repopulate the stream items with actual data from
    the EC Revenue Quantities module, table STIM_MTH_ACTUAL. Also, this section will
    handle cases where there are no stream items for a given combination of Field
    and Product Object, i.e. a pure Gas Field will not have any Crude Stream Items.
    For these cases the table will simply have no quantity for the given Field / Product
    Object. This section have NULL-handling in order to ensure correct sub-totals,
    grand totals, sum in BOE, and sum in BOE/day in case of ?missing? stream item.</p><p>This
    section has a button for setting the forecast quantities and comments for the
    selected Field to VERIFIED. The ?VERIFY? button is only be accessible by users
    having the access rights set accordingly, i.e. access rights to change record
    status from PROVISIONAL to VERIFIED.</p><p>?&nbsp;Field Comments Section<br>This
    section manages one or more Comments for the selected combination of Quantity
    Forecast Case and Field. The user can Add / Delete / Modify Field Comments. Each
    Comment is categorized by setting a category for each Comment. The categories
    will be defined by the customer through EC Codes entries. By default there will
    be two Comment Categories defined: GENERAL and MONTH_SPECIFIC. These can be deleted
    and replaced by customer specific Comment categories by the customer.</p><p>The
    Field Comments can only be modified by users having access rights according to
    the record status of the Comments, i.e. if the Comments have been set to VERIFIED
    only users having access rights to modify VERIFED records can change them. The
    same concept applies to APPROVED records.<br></p>'
