  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This BF is used to enter volumetric batch exports. Data comes from
    a LACT (Lease Automatic Custody Transfer) meter, providing opening and closing
    totalizer values. From these values, it is possible to calculate a Net volume
    flow for a given period. This BF can also be used for continuous export into pipeline.</p><p>After
    selecting a &ldquo;From Date&rdquo; and &ldquo;To Date&rdquo; as well as selecting
    the asset and stream of interest, the user will retrieve stream data with the
    associated Net Volume. Note that it will also be possible to create new records
    using the insert button. It is also possible to save a record without having entered
    a closing totalizer value.</p><p>The calculation of VCF (Volume Correct Factor)
    can either be done by pressing the &ldquo;recalculate&rdquo; button or it will
    be done automatically upon save. If data has been loaded using Tag Collector,
    there will not be an automatic calculation. The QA process must then include pressing
    the &ldquo;recalculate&rdquo; button if data is ok, or fix data and press save
    (automatic recalculate).</p><p>Copy forward of override factors can be disabled
    in CO.1006 - Maintain System Settings screen, under Custom Settings -> Period
    Totalizer Screens: Disable copy forward for override factors property.</p>'
