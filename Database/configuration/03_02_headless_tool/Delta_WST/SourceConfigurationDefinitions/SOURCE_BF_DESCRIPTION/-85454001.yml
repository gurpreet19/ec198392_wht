  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">        Transactional Inventory
    module in EC Revenue allows complex        inventory valuations using the EC calculation
    engine. It is a standard        calculation where minimal calculation knowledge
    is required and can be        fully configured through creating EC objects and
    configuration. It has        been designed with the intention of creating templates
    with standard        functionality. And for the cases that do not conform to the
    normal        rules, overrides can be created to cater for the exceptions.    </em></p><p>    <strong>Transactional

    Templates and their settings<br>    These Templates are added to Sets that allow
    the user to change between    layouts for an Inventory and Product Stream.</p><p>    -
