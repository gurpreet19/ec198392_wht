  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The Daily Facility Balancing screen enables the user to view product
    balances, check tolerances, and drill down to the details behind the volumes.
    This is done in order to diagnose and resolve volumetric data issues as part of
    the daily volumetric accounting process. This BF will work as a single point of
    access for users to perform facility balancing of product volumes and assist in
    diagnosing volumetric issues. This BF will support the balancing activity by the
    following measures:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>All
    inventories, dispositions, receipt, and production volumes are accounted for selected
    facility.</li><li>Proration factors and metering differences are in tolerance.</li><li>Determining
    the derived volume for each product at the facility.</li></ul><p>The key objective
    of facility balance is to ensure that the volume for "Product In = Product Out".
    Any imbalances will appear as "Imbalance" attribute value on the screen.</p><p>As
    a default configuration "Product In" calculation captures volumes from the Balance
    Groups listed below:</p><span><div class="ui-datatable ui-widget"><div class="ui-datatable-tablewrapper"><table
