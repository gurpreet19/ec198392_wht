  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Data Entry Reconciliation screen</strong>    is for
    reconciling the individual Data Entries to make sure all the interfaced source
    entries have been handled in terms of Mapped and Excluded entries.</p><h2>    <strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Navigator</strong></h2><p>    Navigator has following
    data fields for filtering and grouping the result:<br>    <strong><em>Period:</em></strong>    The
    financial period of the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>Group Source By:</em></strong>    How
    to group the data in the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>Document Key:</em></strong>    The
    Document Key of the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>Project:</em></strong>    The
    Project of the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>Document Type:</em></strong>    The
    Document Type of the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>WBS:</em></strong>    Specific
    WBS in the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>Cost Center:</em></strong>    Specific
    Cost Center in the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>Account:</em></strong>    Specific
    Account in the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>Source Project:</em></strong>    The
    Source Project of the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>Source Dataset:</em></strong>    The
    Source Dataset of the Data Entry Document,<br>    <strong><em>Show Zero Variance:</em></strong>    Indicates
    if zero variance records should be displayed or not.</p><p>    Based in the filter
    values the screen will load the Data Entries for the selected Data Entry Document.</p><h2>    <strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Tabs</strong></h2><p>    <h3><strong>Tab Amount</strong></h3>
    <strong>It is for reconciling monetary values. </strong> <br>    <u>The work area
    data section has these columns:</u><br>    <strong><em>Target Project Name:</em></strong>    The
    name of the Target Project,<br>    <strong><em>Source:</em></strong>    The various
    unique source entries according to the Group Source By in the filter,<br>    <strong><em>Interfaced:</em></strong>    The
    Interfaced value from the source document,<br>    <strong><em>Mapped:</em></strong>    The
    value of the Mapped entries,<br>    <strong><em>Excluded:</em></strong>    The
    value of the Excluded entries,<br>    <strong><em>Total:</em></strong>    The
    sum of the Mapped and Excluded entries,<br>    <strong><em>Variance:</em></strong>    The
    difference between the Interfaced value and the Total, e.g. the value that has
    NOT been Mapped nor Excluded,<br>    <strong><em>Other Entries:</em></strong>    The
    value of any additional Data Entries added to the Data Entry Document that did
    not come from the interfaced source entries.</p><h3><strong>Tab Quantity</strong></h3><p>    <strong>It
    is for reconciling quantities.</strong> <br>    The work area have the same layout
    as the Amount tab - dealing with Quantities instead of Amounts</p><p>    <strong>Button

    button will launch a modal popup window Data Mapping Reconciliation- for more

    section of this screen will list the document selected in the Reconcile Data Entry
    screen.<br>    - The main part of the screen is a table containing all the un-mapped
    entries. <u>For each entry the table shows some key columns:</u><br>    <strong><em>Select:</em></strong>    This
    is a tick-box to be ticked if you want to run the Variance Handling which is executed
    from a button in the screen (see below).<br>    <strong><em>Data Entry No:</em></strong>    This
    is the Data Entry number in the source file.<br>    <strong><em>Cost Load Amount:</em></strong>    The
    amount in the source record.<br>    <strong><em>Mapped Amount:</em></strong>    The
    amount that has been mapped.<br>    <strong><em>Excluded Amount:</em></strong>    The
    amount that has been excluded from the mappings.<br>    <strong><em>Variance:</em></strong>    The
    amount that has not yet been handled, i.e. Cost Load Amount- Mapped Amount - Excluded
    Amount.<br>    <strong><em>Variance %:</em></strong>    This is the Variance value
    in per cent of the total interfaced value. The Variance % should be zero for all
    entries for a fully reconciled document.<br>    <strong><em>Project / WBS / Cost
    Centre / Revenue Order / Document Type / Account:</em></strong>    These are for
    information only - but can of course be used for filtering and sorting.</p><p>    <strong>Button

    the Variance for the selected (Ticked!) entry in the main table. See section Variance

    whole amount or part of the amount to an existing mapping<br>    - Map the whole
    amount or part of the amount to a new mapping<br>    - Exclude the whole amount
