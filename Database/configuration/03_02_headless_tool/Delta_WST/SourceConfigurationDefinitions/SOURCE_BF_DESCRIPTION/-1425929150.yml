  DESCRIPTION: <p> This is forecast screen of CP.0028 Contract Delivery Tracking. This screen is used for forecast monitoring of contract deliveries / plan (Annual Delivery Plan) for any given delivery program year. Within the oil and gas business and especially within the LNG domain it is critical to at any time be able to track and report on how the plant is performing with regards to its contractual commitments. Long term contracts are typically monitored on a 12 month basis where the start of the contract year is not always January 1st.  </p>
