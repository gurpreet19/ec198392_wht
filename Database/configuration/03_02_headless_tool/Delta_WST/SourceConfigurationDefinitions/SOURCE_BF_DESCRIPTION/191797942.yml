  DESCRIPTION: <p>This Business Function is used to keep track of load oil transported from a facility to one or more facility production wells. Load oil is typically pumped into the well to stop the well flow before doing well maintenance. The business function supports one single load operation of the truck from a given facility stream and one or more unloading operations of truck content into facility wells. Below is a simple illustration of the situation.</p><p>The truck driver will first register the amount of load oil pumped into the truck. This will include:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Gross volume</li><li>BSW% sample</li></ul><p>Based on this oil net volume and water are calculated and shown on the screen.</p><p>When pumping load oil into the wells the truck driver will only estimate the gross volume delivered into the well (without taking a BSW sample).</p><p>All information is registered by the truck driver in the trucking company registration system (laptop or a paper form). A single load or unload registration is called a <em>Ticket. </em>All tickets originating from the same truck load are typically grouped into a <em>Batch. </em></p><p>Entering data into this BF always starts by registering the data against the source stream loading fluid into the truck. This is typically performed after the truck has been loaded with fluid. Well ticket data is typically entered into EC by an operator after receiving all well tickets from the truck driver at the end of the day.</p><p><u>Prorate functionality</u></p><p>In theory, the truck loaded volume should match the sum of unloaded volumes, but will in practice differ as for the loaded quantities and unloaded quantities are typically measured with different measurement devices with different accuracy. The quality of the source stream meter is assumed to be the most accurate. The business function, therefore, supports prorating the source stream gross, net and water values back to the wells pro-rate so the well volumes will sum up the total volume loaded into the truck. This will be performed automatically when saving screen content.</p><p>Since there is no BSW registered at the wells, this business function will use the BSW sample taken on the facility source stream when calculating well prorated net oil and water volumes.</p><p>Well gross, net oil and water volumes will be prorated to match the corresponding gross, net oil and water volumes on the source stream as illustrated below:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Allocation integration</u></p><p>A well that has been loaded with load oil will produce the load oil volume first when setting back into production. This produced load oil should not be accredited as well production as it was imported. The allocation data read therefore supports reading following values per well:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Daily opening accumulated gross and net load oil volume.</li><li>Daily received gross and net load oil per well.</li></ul><p>These values can then be incorporated into the well calculation rule so that the produced oil and water part of the load oil will be deducted from the theoretical net oil and water production volumes. This will, however, require that the implementation projects using load oil do some small modifications to the well calculation rule EC_WELL_01 delivered part of EC Production.</p><p>The allocation data write supports writing back:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Day closing accumulated gross and net load oil.</li><li>Daily produced gross and net load oil (is assumed to come up first before the actual reservoir oil).</li><li>Daily received gross and net load oil.</li></ul><p>Some projects only register ticket number and not batch numbers. These projects can simply deactivate the <em>Batch Number </em>attribute and it will then not show up on the screen.</p>
