  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Forecast Gas Sales Prices screen</strong> is used for forecasting
    the prices of the gas sales.</p><p>In the navigator the user selects which forecast
    case to view or edit. The selection criteria may include a field group. The user
    may then select among the field groups that have the field group type selected
    when the forecast case was set up.</p><p>In the table below the navigator an overview
    of the quantities for the selected forecast case is shown. The numbers in this
    table are yearly numbers by field with a sum row at the bottom. If a field group
    was selected in the navigator, this table will only include the fields that are
    members of that group.</p><p>Then a month-by-month table showing monthly numbers
    by field is displayed. This table also includes an adjustment line. The content
    of this line is the difference between last year''s December accrual numbers and
    the actual December numbers. All quantity data entry will be done through this
    table.</p><p>At the very bottom of the screen is a section where the user can
    enter comments. Any number of comments can be inserted by normal insert functionality,
    not necessarily four rows as in the example screenshot above. The comments will
    be by forecast case, product and field.</p><p>All parts of the forecast case will
    be populated when the Populate Forecast Case on the Properties screen is pressed.
    The quantity part of this logic will work as follows:</p><ul><li>The numbers in
    the Plan Qty column will be copied from the referenced quantity forecast case
    that is selected on the Properties panel by using the selected stream items for
    the forecast object.</li><li>If the Populate Method is PLAN, then all columns
    except the Plan Qty column will initially be empty. The user will then have to
    enter Commercial Adjustment, Swap Adjustment and Sales Qty. Available Sale will
    be Plan Qty less the two adjustments. Inventory Movement will be Available Sale
    less Sales Qty.</li><li>In the month-by-month table the rows will get status PLAN
    if the Populate Method is PLAN or if the month in question is later than the Forecast
    Case month. In the screenshot above, the forecast case''s month is May, and therefore
    the June thru December months are editable.</li><li>For the months after the month
    of the Forecast Case, the adjustment quantities and the sales quantity will be
    copied from the official forecast case for the previous month. The user may change
    them if necessary. The plan quantity will be copied from the connected quantity
    forecast case. This will trigger a recalculation of available sales quantity and
    inventory movement.</li><li>For the months up to and including the month of the
    Forecast Case object, actual numbers will be copied into forecast case. The Plan
    Qty will be actual numbers copied from the selected stream items. The Commercial
    Adjustment will sum all as-is quantities from the quantities module for the selected
    stream item category for the month and field in question. The Swap Adjustment
    quantity will be calculated the same way using the selected stream item category
    for Swap Adjustments. Available Sale will then be Plan Qty less Commercial Adjustment
    and Swap Adjustment. The Sales Qty will be sum of all quantities sold from the
    field in the month in question. This lookup is done by finding the line items
    selling from the field in question that belong to transactions with point of sale
    date within the month in question. The documents that these transactions belong
    to must be set to BOOKED. Finally, Inventory Movement will be the difference between
    Available Sale and Sales Qty. The status will be ACCRUAL if any of the actual
    numbers are ACCRUAL. All actual numbers must have status FINAL for the record
    to get status FINAL.</li><li>An exception to this will be made to the Sales Qty
    for the month after the forecast case''s month, i.e. June in the example screenshot
    above. There will be a lifting plan for the cargos in this month, and therefore
    this number will be fetched from the actual tables and not from the official forecast
    case for the previous month. The number will however still be editable for the
    user to change if necessary.</li><li>On the Prior Year Adjustment line the user
    has to enter any adjustments and the Sales Qty. The Available Sale and the Inventory
    Movement will then be calculated. For liquids shipped by cargos, there will normally
    not be any adjustments to the sales quantity. This means that any adjustment to
    the available sales quantity will only influence the inventory movement. The sales
    quantity cell will nonetheless be editable for the user to enter any number.</li></ul><p><strong>Populate
    Method = PLAN</strong></p><ul><li>Term Price - The product has a general price:
    The monthly valid general price is fetched from price values tables for the product
    in question. The column is editable.</li><li>Term Price - The product does not
    have a general price: The column is initially empty and editable.When term prices
    are entered manually, then these values should be preserved when re-populating.</li><li>Spot
    Price - The product has a general price: The monthly valid general price is fetched
    from price values tables for the product in question. The column is editable.</li><li>Spot
    Price - The product does not have a general price: The column is initially empty
    and editable.When spot prices are entered manually, then these values should be
    preserved when re-populating.</li><li>Forex: The MONTH exchange rate for the Pricing
    Currency and the Local Currency in question. Column is editable.</li><li>Local
    Term Price: Local Term Price = Term Price * Forex. Not editable.</li><li>Local
    Term Price: Local Spot Price = Spot Price * Forex. Not editable.</li></ul><p><strong>Populate
    Method = YEAR TO MONTH</strong></p><ul><li>Term Price - The Term Price prior to
    Plan Date = NULL and not editable. The Term Price is editable after the Plan Date.</li><li>Spot
    Price - The Spot Price prior to Plan Date = NULL and not editable. The Spot Price
    is editable after the Plan Date.</li><li>Forex: The MONTH exchange rate for the
    Pricing Currency and the Local Currency in question. Column is editable.</li><li>Local
    Term Price: The Local Term Price prior to the Plan Date is the sum of the actual
    sales (monetary values on the contract documents) for the Product, Company and
    Field in question for Term type of contracts only. Only documents which are booked
    and where the transaction date is prior to the Plan Date are considered. This
    sum divided by the Term Sales Qty (ref. Term Sales Qty column above in Quantities
    screen) gives us the local term price. The Local Term Price after the Plan Date
    = Term Price * Forex. Not editable.</li><li>Local Spot Price: The Local Price
    prior to the Plan Date is the sum of the actual sales (monetary values on the
    contract documents) for the Product, Company and Field in question for Spot type
    of contracts only. Only documents which are booked and where the transaction date
    is prior to the Plan Date are considered. This sum divided by the Spot Sales Qty
    (ref. Spot Sales Qty column above in Quantities screen) gives us the local spot
    price. The Local Spot Price after the Plan Date = Spot Price * Forex. Not editable.</li></ul>'
