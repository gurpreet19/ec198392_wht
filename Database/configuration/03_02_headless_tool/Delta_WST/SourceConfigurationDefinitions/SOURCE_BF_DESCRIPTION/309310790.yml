If a berth is selected in the navigator the calendar will show the highlighted day when the cargoes is unloaded on the selected berth. If the berth is not selected in navigator then the calendar will show the highlighted day when cargoes is unloaded on all berths. Berth slots are available if the days in the calendar is not highlighted.</p><p>Mouse over a highlighted day in the calendar will show tooltip text of the berth name, cargoes and the status of the berth slot which is either occupied or in conflict (overlapping of cargoes) or unassigned (Berth not assigned).
