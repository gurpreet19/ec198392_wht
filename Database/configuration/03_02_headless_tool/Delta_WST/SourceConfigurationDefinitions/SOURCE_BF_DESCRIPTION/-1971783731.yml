  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>Reservoir Block Formation defines the intersection zone between Reservoir Block and Formation. This vertical and horizontal part of the reservoir can also be tagged with a voidage group to link different areas together.</p>

    <p>Reservoir Block Formation zone can also be attached to a Commercial Entity.</p>

    <p>Perforation Intervals are connected to a Reservoir Block Formation zone. It is possible to set up reservoir allocation that will split allocated Well production/injection figures down to the Reservoir Block Formation zone, using Perforation Interval splits, Well Bore Interval splits, Well Bore splits and allocated Well production/injection figures. The aggregated allocated figures per Reservoir Block Formation will then be written back to the database. The allocated results can then be extracted using the generated report layer.</p>
