  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to display, update or add general prices for a product.</p><p>The normal process is to calculate the general product prices by the EC calculation engine, typically based on price indices. This would typically be a scheduled job,&nbsp;or can be initiated from the Price Calculation (PR.0008) business function. The calculated prices can be adjusted in the &ldquo;Adjusted Price&rdquo; column. The price value&nbsp;available externally (reporting, EC Revenue, etc) will be &ldquo;Adjusted Price&rdquo; if this is available, else it will be &ldquo;Calculated Price&rdquo;.<br />If prices are not calculated by the EC calculation engine, this business function also supports manual insert of prices.</p><p>The implementation of this business function is done in a generic manner. That means that it can be used to show many different price dimensions. The product&nbsp;comes with a set of predefined treeview entries, but the project can add more as needed.</p><p>The navigator lets the user select price objects by using the navigation mode. Further the user can select a Product and a Data set.</p>
