  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen is used to view / edit delivery point targets. Initially the delivery point target is equal the the (last sent) output nominations. The dispatcher can change&nbsp;the target if required. If required the target can be imported from external interfaces, e.g Process Model. The target is stored at sub daily level, and summarized to&nbsp;day level. This target is normally edited on d-1 (meaning, one day before a given day).</p><p>In the Navigator, the user selects the date to which the delivery point target relates. The &ldquo;Go&rdquo; button will execute a search on the database and return for delivery&nbsp;points, the sum of the output nominations and the target. When a delivery point is selected in Day Target section, all the hourly rates are listed in Hourly Target&nbsp;section.</p><p>New sub daily delivery point targets are instantiated on d-2.</p>
