  DESCRIPTION: '<p>Automatic Deferment Raw Data screen is used to monitor status of
    well and maintain proposed events. The staging area maintains well status in ON/OFF
    state. This screen is read only and gives option to automatically or manually
    create deferment events.</p><p>The data coming from SCADA are fed into ''Raw data''
    section in this screen. Business user can configure threshold limit for creating
    proposed event. Events are created upon reaching threshold value. For example:
    Let''s take threshold of 15 minutes. A well whose status has changed to ''Off''
    at 00:00, will wait till new record of 00:15 appears with same status. Then new
    deferment event is created at 00:15, with the start date of 00:00.</p><p>Curtailment
    of routines are handled in following ways:</p><ul><li>Delete repetitive status.</li><li>Delete
    false positive (noise entry).</li></ul><p>Automatic deferment has three data sections:</p><ul><li>Raw
    Data - This section which captures object name, status, time, event created.</li><li>Proposed
    Deferment Events - Captures proposed deferment events based on raw data inputs.</li><li>System
    Settings - This section shows properties configured in Maintain System Settings
    (CO.1006).</li></ul><p>Well  Object Types are populated based on the ''Operational''
    or ''Collection Point'' group model.</p><p>Configuration in Maintain System Settings
