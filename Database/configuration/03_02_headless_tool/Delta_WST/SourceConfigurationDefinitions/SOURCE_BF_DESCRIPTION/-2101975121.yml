  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>

    <p>Collection Point is part of the collection point group model.  This group model is typically used for big onshore operations where operators have a route to drive to collect data for a set of wells. Operator may not necessarily know which facility the wells belong to, they just have a route.</p>

    <p>Collection Points are linked to assets like Well, Stream and Tank, but that connection is not a group model connection. To make that connection, use the BF Collection Point Connection. Advantage is that the users can maintain the connection themselves without going to the configuration screen.</p>
