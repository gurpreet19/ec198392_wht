  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>HCB System screen</strong>    is used to show if the
    System is in balance or imbalance. The output of the HCB process is a Report.</p><p><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">    The HCB (Hydrocarbon Balance) is a feature
    for giving an overview of the    whole value chain in terms of hydrocarbons taking
    into account production,    inventory, fuel/flare, injection, sales and purchases
    values.</span></p><p>    HCB is a key component of EC Revenue functionality. It
    is the means by    which quantities collected through each of the modules and
    are compared for    consistency, on a daily, monthly, or other period basis.<br>    Although
    the quantities may be registered through any of the transactional    modules,
    the HCB functionality belongs to QTY, since this is where all    Stream Item Values
    ultimately reside.</p><p>    <u>The screen is divided into two sections:</u></p><p><strong><em>HCB
    Systems Section</em></strong><br>The section lists existing HCB Systems</p><p><strong><em>HCB
    System Details Section</em></strong><br>    The section contains details for each
    HCB System such as Units of    measurement and Category.</p>'
