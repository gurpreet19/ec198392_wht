  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The business function is used to maintain the navigation model used in EC Transport, EC Sale and EC Revenue.</p>

    <p>The navigation model is generic and can hold different models. It reuses the relations found on classes. It even supports many to many relationships between objects. Notice that the multiplicity then becomes N:1, instead of 1:N (default).</p>

    <p>After changes are done on a model, the button &lsquo;Synchronise Model&rsquo; must be run. This will update the table &lsquo;NAV_MODEL_OBJECT_RELATION&rsquo;. This is important to keep updated as this is used in navigators when drilling down to target class.</p>

    <p>To regenerate all models the &lsquo;Synchronise All&rsquo; button can be used.</p>

    <p>To create a new model just do insert on the current selection. Make sure that a unique model name is selected. After save the navigator popup will list the new model.</p>
