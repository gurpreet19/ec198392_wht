The mappings is in essence a matrix where one defines which objects to use for both rows and columns in the Business Function.</p><p>In data section (1) Objects the rows will be defined. This is a popup of Profit Centres, in most cases this will be Field or Subfield. Together with the object one can define the unit to display in the resulting business function and the unit used to store data in the database.</p><p>Data section (2) Cells are used to define the columns and the column mappings. Each column or more precisely a cell may reference one or more stream values. This might be either measured data from streams or allocated data. In the case where a cell references multiple stream values the values are added up. The Where Clause - column have to be on the form &quot;AND <attribute> = x&quot;. The Grouping Type-column is currently designed to hold a string SUB_DAILY if the attribute should be shown in the sub-daily data section of the Business Function SD.0013 - Wet Gas Export and Fuel.</p>
