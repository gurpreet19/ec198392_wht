  DESCRIPTION: '<p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;">    <strong>Contract Properties
    screen </strong>    is responsible for creating Contract objects.</p><p style="font-family:
    Arial, Verdana;">    The <strong>Contract object</strong> is the basis for most
    of the business processes handled by the Financial Transaction module. The Contract
    will be    basis for generating Documents such as invoices, credit notes, purchase
    orders, bills, etc.</p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;">    Defining EC
    Revenue Contract is a complex operation covered by a number of Business Functions:<br>    -
    <strong>SP.0007</strong> - Contract Properties    <br>    Defines overall general
    properties for the Contract    <br>    - <strong>SP.0008</strong> - Contract Price
    Object    <br>    Defines the Products and Price Concepts in use for the Contract    <br>    -
    <strong>SP.0009</strong> - Contract Company Spits    <br>    Defines the Vendor
    and Customer for the Contract and Bank Accounts for the Vendor and Customer    <br>    -
    <strong>SP.0011</strong> - Contract Price List    <br>    Defines Quantity Unit
    Prices for the contract    <br>    - <strong>SP.0012</strong> - Document Properties    <br>    Defines
    various types of documents possible to generate for the Contract    <br>    -
    <strong>SP.0013</strong> - Document Text Setup    <br>    Defines Header and Footer
    text for each of the Document types for the Contract    <br>    - <strong>SP.0014</strong>
    - Transaction Properties    <br>    Defines Transactions for each of the Document
    types for the Contract    <br>    - <strong>SP.0015</strong> - Line Item Properties<br>    Defines
    the Line Items for each of the Transactions    <br>    - <strong>SP.0026 - </strong>Transaction
    Distribution Setup    <br>    Defines the Fields or Profit Centers to distribute
    transaction quantities and values to the SP Contract objects are time-spanned
    and versioned in such a    way that within the time-span of the Contract it is
    possible to create versions.</p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;">    The
    different areas of the Contract concept will have their own versioning within
    the time-span of the Contract itself:<br>    - <strong>SP.0007</strong> - Contract
    Properties has its own versioning schema with Start Dates and End Dates    <br>    -
    <strong>SP.0008</strong> - Contract Price Object has its own versioning schema
    with Start Dates and End Dates    <br>    - <strong>SP.0009</strong> - Contract
    Company Spits has its own versioning schema with Start Dates and End Dates    <br>    -
    <strong>SP.0011</strong> - Contract Price List has its own versioning schema with
    Valid From Dates    <br>    - <strong>SP.0012</strong> - Document Properties:
    Follows the Start and End dates defined for <strong>SP.0007</strong> - Contract
    Properties screen    <br>    - <strong>SP.0013</strong> - Document Text Setup:
    Follows the Start and End dates defined for <strong>SP.0007</strong> - Contract
    Properties screen    <br>    - <strong>SP.0014</strong> - Transaction Properties
    has its own versioning schema with Start Dates and End Dates for each Transaction    <br>    -
    <strong>SP.0015</strong> - Line Item Properties: Follows the versions defined
    for <strong>SP.0014</strong> - Transaction Properties screen<br>    - <strong>SP.0027</strong>
    - Transaction Distribution: Follows the versions defined for <strong>SP.0014</strong>
    - Transaction Properties screen</p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;">    <strong>Please
    note</strong>    that all Business Functions having their own versioning schema
    must comply with the overall Start Date and End Date (optionally) set by the Contract    object.
    This means that the BFs listed above which have their own versioning schema cannot
    have Version Start Dates prior to the Contract Start Date or    Version End Dates
    after the Contract End Date.</p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;">    <strong>The
    Contract End Date</strong>    is optional as it may be set to NULL meaning the
    Contract is valid forever.</p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;">    When
    Processing a Contract generating a new Document the system will copy information
    from the Contract domain making sure the information copied is picked    from
    the correct version for all of the different areas (SP.0007 - SP.0015). For more
    information on the Contract Processing, please see BF documentation    for BFs
    from SP.0016 to SP.0021.</p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;">    <strong>Distribution
    Class</strong>    attribute defines how to allocate quantities and financial values
    for the Transactions taking part in a Document. The options are:<br>    <span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><strong>- </strong>    </span><strong><span style="color:
    rgb(0, 0, 153);">        FIELD</span>:            </strong>The quantities and
    financial values are allocated to one particular Field, defined for each Transaction
    Template. The    <strong><em>Transaction Distribution parameter</em></strong>
    will be set to N (No), i.e. there is no need to define Transaction Distribution
    Setups.<br>    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><strong>- </strong>    </span><strong><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">        FIELD_GROUP</span>:            </strong>    The
    quantities and financial values are allocated to one or more Fields being part
    of the Field Group defined for each Transaction Template.        The <strong><em>Transaction
    Distribution parameter</em></strong> will be set to Y (Yes), i.e. Transaction
    Distribution Setups need to be defined for each    Transaction Template.    <br>    <span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><strong>- </strong>    </span><strong><span style="color:
    rgb(0, 0, 153);">        PROFIT_CENTER</span>:            </strong>The quantities
    and financial values are allocated to one particular Profit Center, defined for
    each Transaction Template. The    <strong><em>Transaction Distribution parameter</em></strong>
    will be set to N (No), i.e. there is no need to define Transaction Distribution
    Setups.<br>    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><strong>- </strong>    </span><strong><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">        PROFIT_CENTER_COLLECTION</span>:            </strong>    The
    quantities and financial values are allocated to one or more Profit Centers being
    part of the Profit Center Collection defined for each Transaction    Template.
    The <strong><em>Transaction Distribution parameter</em></strong> will be set to
    Y (Yes), i.e. Transaction Distribution Setups need to be defined    for each Transaction
    Template.</p><p>    <strong><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Contract Properties
    screen is divided into following sections</span>:</strong><br>    <strong><em>-
    Filter Navigator:</em></strong><br>    The Filter Navigator lists all the contracts
    being valid at the date selected in the Filter Navigator. By clicking a contract
    object in the Filter    Navigator all the documents defined for the contract will
    be listed in the Document List section.<br>    <strong><em>- Create Version -
    Copy To New Section:</em></strong><br>    For each contract it is possible to
    create versions with a particular start-date (version date). The version date
    has to be within the Start Date and End    Date of the contract itself. It is
    not allowed to create a new version having version date the same as an existing
    version.<br>    This section also allows for creating a copy of a contract. The
    Start Date of the contract copy has to be within the Start Date and End Date of
    the    contract to be copied.<br>    <strong><em>- Create Version - Create Contract
    Template:</em></strong><br>    The Create Contract Template button will copy all
    necessary data from Frame Agreement to the new contract. There will be a default
    implementation of this    by the product, but a user_exit can be used to override
    it.<br>    <strong><em>- Create Version - Create Deal Contract</em></strong><br>    The
    Create Deal Contract button will copy all necessary data from selected Deal Contract
    Template to the new contract. There will be a default    implementation of this
    by the product, but a user_exit can be used to override it<br>    <strong><em>-
    Contract Details:</em></strong><br>    This section of the screen lists all the
    attributes and relations defined for a contract. It will show the version of the
    contract being valid at the date    selected in the Filter Navigator.</p>   <p>
    All Financial Transaction screens are used for different purposes based on Financial
    Code. A short description of the different types:<br>    - <strong>Sales</strong>:
    This is sales of different hydrocarbons.    <br>    - <strong>Purchases</strong>:
    This is purchases of different hydrocarbons.    <br>    - <strong>Tariff</strong>
    <strong>Income</strong>: This is revenues/sales from use of pipeline capacity
    or any other service.    <br>    - <strong>Tariff</strong> <strong>Cost</strong>:
    This is costs/purchases from use of pipeline capacity or any other service.    <br>    -
    <strong>Frame</strong> <strong>agreement</strong>    <br>    - <strong>Journal</strong>
    <strong>Entry</strong></p>    <p> The different financial codes are:  <br>    -
    SALE used for sales    <br>    - PURCHASE used for purchases    <br>    - TA_INCOME
    used for tariff income    <br>    - TA_COST used for tariff cost    <br>    -
    FRAME used for frame agreement.    <br>    - JOU_ENT used for Journal Entry</p><p>    SALE
    and TA_INCOME are both considered as sales while PURCHASE and TA_COST are considered
    as purchases.</p><p>    <strong>FRAME contract functionality.</strong> <br>    The
    Frame / Deal contract functionality will be a 3-level concept with levels as follows:<br>    1:
    FRAME contract    <br>    2: SALE | PURCHASE | TA_INCOME | TA_COST Template contract    <br>    3:
    Actual SALE | PURCHASE | TA_INCOME | TA_COST contract from which the actual transactions
    will take place</p><p>    <strong>        <em>            - 1. Frame Contract                    </em>    </strong>
    <br>    It is created from scratch setting the financial code = FRAME. The frame
    contract itself will typically NOT have all the details filled out, such as    document
    setups and company splits.    <br>    From the FRAME contract a copy can be created
    using the ''Create Deal Contract'' button.    <br>    The new copy - the template
    contract - will have the financial code initially set to FRAME, but the must can
    change it to either SALE | PURCHASE |    TA_INCOME | TA_COST.</p>    NOTE:    <br>    The
    financial code attribute will be a popup when the financial code = FRAME and the
    contract link &lt;&gt; null - otherwise it is locked.    <br>    The financial
    code will also be editable when creating a new contract due to the new navigation
    model where the financial code is not coming from the    treeview.    <br>    Once
    the financial code has been changed away from FRAME it can not be changed back
    to FRAME or to any other financial code.<p></p><p>    <strong><em>- 2. Deal Template
    Contract</em></strong>    <br>    The template contract is initially created by
    a copy operation from the Frame Contract.    <br>    The new copy will have a
    reference (Contract Link) back to the Frame contract.    <br>    The new copy
    will have CODE set to _DT (short for Deal Template - code length limitation is
    a problem!)    <br>    The new copy will have NAME set to    DEAL TEMPLATE    <br>    The
    next step is then for the user to change CODE, NAME, FINANCIAL_CODE (from FRAME
    to SALE | PURCHASE | TA_INCOME | TA_COST)    <br>    The new copy contract will
    then be filled out with all the details such as document setups, transactions,
    company splits, price objects, etc.    <br>            The new copy will be the
    base contract for the actual deal contracts - this is the deal template contract
    from which the actual deal contracts will be        copied from.     <br>    NOTE:
    <br> It will be possible to have both SALE and a PURCHASE deal contract templates
    under the same frame contract.</p><p>   <strong><em>- 3. Deal Contract</em></strong>                <br>                The
    user can create actual deal contracts by selecting a deal template contract and
    click the ''Create Deal Contract'' button. A copy will be made where       <br>    CODE
    =    _DEAL    <br>   NAME =   _DEAL    <br>            The new copy will have
    a reference (Contract Link) back to the Frame contract - not the Deal Template
    Contract. This way we can easily find all        contracts / documents under the
    same frame agreement.        <br>   The Processable Code of the actual deal contract
    will be set to Y    <br>    The copy will be an exact copy of the deal template
    contract - EXCEPT NO PRICE VALUES WILL BE COPIED</p><p>   <strong>NOTE: </strong>   <br>        The
    Filter Navigator for contracts is currently only showing contracts having FINANCIAL_CODE
    set according to the FINANCIAL_CODE coming from the        treeview.        <br>    This
    will change with the new navigation model where the user selects in the navigator
    which    <br>    This should be changed such that the filter navigator also includes
    the frame contracts, i.e. FINANCIAL_CODE = FRAME.</p>'
