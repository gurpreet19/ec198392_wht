  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to enter event based Waste Injectors well data. All wells having well type &lsquo;Waste&rsquo; (WA) will show up in the well popup. The BF is event based and all records within from and to date in the navigator are listed. Pressing Insert, a new row will be created open for input. Default date is similar to &ldquo;To Date&rdquo; in the navigator. The list of events is sorted on date (descending) and then well. The Waste Type popup can be configured in EC_CODES. There are no calculations associated with this BF, it&rsquo;s purely for data registration.</p>
