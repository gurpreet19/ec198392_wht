  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p>The Tank Usage Screen is used to connect Tanks to Storages. A tank can be connected to several Storages at the same time. The connection to the Storage is time controlled, where each Tank-Storage (tank usage) connection will have daytime and an end date. The end date can be empty.</p>

    <p>The group navigator is used for navigation down to Storage. The Tank dropdown will include all Tanks in the system regardless of navigator choices. The <em>OTHER </em><em>STORAGE </em><em>CONNECTION </em>data section at the bottom of the screen shows any previous Storage connections for the Tank chosen in the first data section.</p>
