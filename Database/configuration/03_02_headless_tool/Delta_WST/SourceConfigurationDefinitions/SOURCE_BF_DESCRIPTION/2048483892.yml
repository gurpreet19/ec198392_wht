  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to enter and view capacity restriction on operational restriction.</p><p>An operation object can be objects like PIPELINE and DELIVERY_POINT. The objects where an implementation needs capacity, the object must implement the OPERATIONAL_RESTRICTION interface.</p><p>Capacity restrictions can happen, either due to planned or unplanned events. This information is needed by the scheduling process for balancing the contracts against the allowable physical limitations of the pipeline.</p><p>By selecting an object in the navigator the restriction for selected period will be listed. A new restriction can be entered by pressing the insert button. The restricted capacity can be looked at in two ways. It can represent a daily capacity or as the total capacity for the period. The example implementation on the class action trigger, anticipate that the restricted capacity is a daily figure.</p><p>Note that restriction can be calculated based on other restrictions and the output from capacity calculation can be viewed here. The calculation can be customized in user exit package. When it is modified, the calculation defined in the user exit package will override the product calculation on capacity restrictions.</p>
