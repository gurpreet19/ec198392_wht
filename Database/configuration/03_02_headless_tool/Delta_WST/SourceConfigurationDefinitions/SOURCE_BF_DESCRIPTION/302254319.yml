  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to start the generation of a lifting program.</p><p>A Lifting Program is the generation of nominations against a given storage (a set of tanks containing the same product) over a period. The idea is to generate nominations in such a way that the storage level is kept between the operational limits specified for the storage. What Lifting Account to associate to the nomination will be based on business rules. These business rules are decided by the take-up project/customer and are typically based on contractual agreements.</p><p>To start the generation of a lifting program the period and storage must be selected in the navigator. All started calculations will show in Running Jobs, several calculations may run simultaneously, but only one for each calculation job. The user could also have specified on the minute when to start the calculation, if it was not to start immediately. The Job Start Time is not mandatory to fill in.</p><p>Once a calculation run has been made, the details are displayed in new rows on the screen, one for each run, along with the outcome (e.g. Success of Failure). By highlighting a row from the upper section of the screen, i.e. an individual calculation run, the associated log file summary from that run is displayed in the lower section of the screen and the user can press the Download button to examine the full log file.</p><p>The Calculation Job makes it possible to decide how the calculations will be performed, if several jobs exist then they will run the calculations with different input parameters. These input parameters can be used by the calculation rules to decide which equations to execute.</p><p>The &lsquo;Delete&rsquo; button will delete all nominations within the selected period that is not flagged as fixed or is connected to a cargo that is &lsquo;Official and Tentative&rsquo;. It is &lsquo;Nominated Date&rsquo; that needs to be within the period in the navigator. If storage id is not set in navigator, all nominations for all storages are deleted that is not &lsquo;Fixed&rsquo;.</p><p>The calculation rule that is part of the product is a very simple entitlement based lifting program. There are a few input parameters, but it will basically create a nomination whenever the threshold quantity is exceeded and assign it to the Lifting Account that has the highest availability. The size of the lifting is set on the Storage. If this is null an error is returned.</p>
