    <p>The Monthly Facility Balancing - Adjustments screen allow users to adjust measurement data that affects the month end facility balance. Ideally corrections are made to the original source data however production reporting deadlines may not always allow for sufficient time to correct data at the source.</p>

    <p>Adjustments are entered in the form of a change in volume (i.e. not an override) to the monthly stream quantities that are displayed on the Monthly Facility Balancing screen.</p>

    <p>The screen enables adjustments to:</p>

    <p>- Streams that are configured for the Monthly Facility Balancing screen</p>

    <p>- Trucked quantities based on trucked from and to locations.</p>
