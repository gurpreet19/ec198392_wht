  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used for setting the delivery target. At this stage, the nominations have been received per contract and are shown here. The user can enter&nbsp;a &lsquo;Desired Percent&rsquo; which is a delivery tolerance per nomination. Where entered, the delivery tolerance is applied to the nomination value to give the &lsquo;Desired&nbsp;Quantity&rsquo; of dry gas to be delivered for the contract against the nomination. Since it is possible to receive the nomination in different units, depending on the contract,&nbsp;this screen convert between nomination units and show the &lsquo;Nominated Qty&rsquo; and &lsquo;Desired Qty&rsquo; values in target units. The target unit is set on the class.</p><p>To be able to convert a nomination quantity in one unit to a different unit, calculated values for volume, mass and energy must be written from the calculation engine.&nbsp;The Nominated Unit on contract is used to find the matching delivery unit on contract. Then the target unit is matched to another delivery unit and the Nominated&nbsp;Quantity is prorated the calculated values.</p><p>When pressing the &lsquo;Create Target&rsquo; button the first target for the day is created. The total &lsquo;Desired Qty&rsquo; is used as the target. The starting point of the day is picked&nbsp;from the system attribute &lsquo;PROD_DAY_START&rsquo;.</p><p>The last delivery target will be displayed at the last data section for information purposes.</p>
