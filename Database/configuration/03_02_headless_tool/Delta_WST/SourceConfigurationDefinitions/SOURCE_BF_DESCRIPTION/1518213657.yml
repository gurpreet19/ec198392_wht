  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p>This business function is used to add / modify the constrained capacities for objects at Scenario level, for all phases i.e. OIL, GAS, WAT, COND, GL, DL, WI, GI, SI AND CI </p>

    <p> A constrained object can by default be WELL, PIPELINE, EQUIPMENT, WELL HOOKUP and FACILITY. If there is a need to capture constrained capacity for further objects, these objects must implement the DESIGN_CAP_OBJECTS interface. </p>

    <p> By selecting an object in the navigator the constraint data for the selected date will be listed. A new constraint can be entered by pressing the insert button.</p>

    <p> The constrained object capacity, will typically be used when calculating the capacity for a Scenario network </p>
