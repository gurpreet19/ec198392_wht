    class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-top"></div><p>Filter Condition drop-down is
    introduced to provide flexibility to filter Object Names dropdown on the navigator.
    If the &quot;Existing Records&quot; option is selected, only objects that have
    been inserted in this business function will be filtered. Meanwhile, &quot;All
    Objects&quot; will filter objects based on the selected Facility and Object Type.
    The default option can be configured in the EC Codes(CO.1011), Code Type =''FILTER_TRUCK_TICKET_DATA''.</p><div
    class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-top"><span class="ecTextHeader">Transfer Type</span></div><p>Below
    a list specifying the different possible setups (<em>Transfer Types): </em></p><ul><li>1.
    Export (only registering volume being trucked from a facility object)</li><li>2.
    Import (only registering volume being trucked to a facility object)</li><li>3.
    Internal Transfer (registering both a source and target object as well as figures
    shared by both objects)</li></ul><p>For <em>Transfer Type Export </em>and <em>Import
    </em>the <em>To object </em>field is deactivated as values then are only registered
    against a single object.</p><p>For <em>Transfer Type </em>= <em>Internal Transfer
    </em>data will be &quot;shared&quot; between the source object (<em>Object</em>)
    and target object (<em>To Object</em>). This means that the same gross volume,
    net volume and water volume will be returned for both streams. The target object
    can be at a different facility. The <em>To object </em>dropdown is therefore an
    operational group model stream navigator. If target object belongs to a different
    facility, the user entering data into EC must be set up with proper access.</p><p>Below
    are some examples of different setups:</p><p><u>1. Export</u><br/>A truck connects
    to a given facility object and loads a certain amount of oil. In this setup the
    target is of no interest. E.g. could be trucked to a 3rd party facility not modelled
    within EC.</p><p><u>2. Import</u><br/>A truck arrives at the given facility, connects
    to a given facility object and delivers a certain amount of oil. In this setup
    the source is of no interest, only the oil volume received at the facility. E.g.
    could be import from a 3rd party facility not modelled within EC.</p><p><u>3.
    Internal Transfer</u><br/>A truck transports a certain amount of oil from one
    facility object to another. The target object can be at the same or a different
    facility.</p><p>Field <em>Grs Estimated </em>is normally only registered for Transfer
    Type = <em>Internal Transfer. </em>This is then normally the estimated volume
    loaded into the truck. The <em>Grs Actual, BS&amp;W </em>and <em>Free Water </em>are
    typically measured at the target object. Free water is typically water settled
    during transport and will be drained off from the truck prior to unloading the
    truck into the target stream.</p><p>Net Volume is calculated as Grs Actual * (1-(BSW%/100)).</p>'
