  DESCRIPTION: <p>    <strong>Document Text screen</strong>    defines Header and Footer text objects for a Document. The text objects defined here are copied from the Document Setup when creating a new Document using    the SP.0016 - Document General screen. The functionality of this BF is very similar to the SP.0013 - Document Text Setup screen.</p><p>    All data elements of this screen are disabled when the Document is not OPEN, i.e. Document Level = VALID1 | VALID2 | TRANSFER | BOOKED.</p><p>    <strong>The screen is divided into these sections:</strong><br>    <strong><em> - Filter Navigator:</em></strong><br>    The Filter Navigator lists all the contracts being valid at the date selected in the Filter Navigator. By clicking a contract object in the Filter    Navigator all the documents defined for the contract will be listed in the Document List section.<br>    <strong><em>- Document List:</em></strong><br>    The Document List section lists all the Documents created for the selected contract. By clicking a Document the Document Text objects for the selected    Document will be listed. The first Document will be selected by default<br>    <strong><em>- Header Section, Multi Column:</em></strong><br>    The text objects defined will be part of the header section of the document. In this section the user can add text objects that are divided into three    columns. There is no limit to the number of characters in each column, but please note that if there are too many characters in a column the text might    flow into the next column or wrap when printed on the document hardcopy.<br>    <strong><em>- Header Section, Single Column:</em></strong><br>    These text objects will also be part of the header section of the document. The text will be in one single column. There is no limit to the number of    characters for the column, but please note that if there are too many characters the text might wrap when printed on the document. The text is left    aligned.<br>    <strong><em>- Footer Section, Multi Column:</em></strong><br>    The text objects defined will be part of the footer section of the document. In this section the user can add text objects that are divided into three    columns. There is no limit to the number of characters in each column, but please note that if there are too many characters in a column the text might    flow into the next column or wrap when printed on the document hardcopy.<br>    <strong><em>- Footer Section, Single Column:</em></strong><br>    These text objects will also be part of the footer section of the document. The text will be in one single column. There is no limit to the number of    characters for the column, but please note that if there are too many characters the text might wrap when printed on the document. The text is left    aligned.</p><p>    Within the header section text objects there is sort order support. The header section multi column text objects are sorted together with the header    section single column text objects. The same concept applies for the footer text objects as well.</p><p>    The user can add and delete text objects from all of the four sections. Text objects can be left blank, either to be filled in during document processing    or to stay blank even after document processing. Each text object will have a sort number.</p>
