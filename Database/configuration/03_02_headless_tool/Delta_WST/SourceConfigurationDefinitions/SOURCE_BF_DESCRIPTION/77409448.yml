  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>EC has its own internal message format which is not known to the receiving party of messages. Because of this we need to know what format the external systems expect to receive. The message format function is used to create and attach a format name to a message type. This makes the MHM able to transform the message to the expected external format.</p>

    <p>As a message type can have multiple formats attached, a default format can be specified by enabling the &ldquo;Default External Format&rdquo; checkbox.</p>

    <p>An example would be:</p>

    <p>A message type called DQRS has two formats attached: XML and TEXT.</p>

    <p>XML is selected as the default external format.</p>
