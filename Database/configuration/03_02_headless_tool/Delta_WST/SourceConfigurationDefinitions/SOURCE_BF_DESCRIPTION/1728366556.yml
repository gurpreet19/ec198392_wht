  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This screen is used to maintain compositions for nomination points.
    The user selects a date range, Business Unit and [or Contract Area or Contract
    or Nomination&nbsp;Point] and Forecast and Series from the navigator at the top
    of the screen and presses the &ldquo;Go&hellip;&rdquo; button. The existing planning
    period are displayed in Planning&nbsp;Periods table. The user then selects a planning
    period in the Planning Period table and the compositions for the selected planning
    period are listed in the&nbsp;Components table. It is now possible to add, edit
    or delete individual planning periods in Planning Periods table. The components
    in the Components table are&nbsp;defined in a component set, and can not be modified
    in this screen.</p><p>For each event (date) there must be one value for all components.
    It is not necessary to have a composition for each planning period, since data
    is valid from the&nbsp;time from which is relates until it is superseded by a
    new value, generally, it is only necessary to have a single composition valid
    from the forecast date. This&nbsp;composition will then be &ldquo;carried forward&rdquo;
    for each planning period in the forecast. Note: There is only one set of forecast
    analysis per forecast type for each period&nbsp;for which it is defined, i.e.
    there are no separate high, medium and low values.</p>'
