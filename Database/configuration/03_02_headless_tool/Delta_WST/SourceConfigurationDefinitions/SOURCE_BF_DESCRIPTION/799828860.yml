  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This new generic event-based equipment business function, shipped as a Compressor Event screen. It provides the same functionality as PO.0064-Equipment Event Data but for a specific equipment.</p>

    <p>The screen is generic in the sense that it takes a Data Class name as parameter. Note that the data class must be:</p>

    <p>- Equipment oriented</p>

    <p>- Mapped to PO.0064</p>

    <p>A project can set up several instances of this screen by ensuring that correct equipment data class is passed as a parameter in the tree view.</p>

    <p>For this business function, the data can be manually inserted (event based), instantiated (daily), or loaded using EC Integration Services.</p>

    <p>This BF supports situations where each piece of equipment can be linked to up to 4 data classes, where each data class defines the appropriate data elements. This means that the screen will have a summary row with 4 related tabs, one tab for each data class related to the equipment object. The mapping of data classes to each of the 4 tabs is established during initial setup of the equipment object, and then the Compressor Event Data BF will dynamically display the correct data class in the appropriate tab.</p>

    <p>If the compressor object only needs one data class, then that one appears in tab 1.</p>

    <p>The <strong>navigator </strong>section enables the selection of a time window where Event Day is From Date and To Date.</p>

    <p>The navigator is based on the configured group model down to the facility level. The equipment elements are optional. If included, the <em>equipment event data set </em>must contain the selected equipment as active equipment for the equipment class in order to be listed.</p>

    <p>Navigator selections are applied when pressing the [GO] &ndash;button.</p>
