  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The Daily Deferment Master (PD.0004) and the Daily Deferment Summary are two BF&rsquo;s that can be used to follow up and track lost volume on a daily basis. These BF&rsquo;s are not driven by individual well deferred volumes but rather facility or area volumes and therefore by using these BF&rsquo;s it will not be possible to calculate a well on time from deferment events nor calculate the well theoretical rate from potential minus deferred volumes.</p>

    <p>The main advantage by using Daily Deferment Master &amp; Daily Deferment Summary is that you can follow up deferred volumes every day and make sure that the difference between your planned max capacity and actual production is distributed to open deferment events.</p>

    <p>The Daily Deferment Summary is used to enter daily deferred volumes against Loss Events.</p>

    <p>1- EC will automatically instantiate daily records for every day the Loss Event lasts. The first day, an initial deferred volume will be copied from Daily Deferment Master &ndash; Deferment Event section. Next day this volume will be adjusted for hours down and a new proposed deferred volume will be saved during instantiation.</p>

    <p>2- The end user will have to adjust deferred volumes so that the report in the lower section shows Unassigned = 0 for all phases. It is however not a requirement that this is 0.</p>

    <p>There will be one important decision to make before using these two BF&rsquo;s. You have to decide at which level in the operational group model you want to store events against. This level is configurable by setting the system attribute &quot;DAILY_DEFERMENT_LEVEL&quot;. The summary report will sum all events belonging to this level and it will not be possible to make a summary report for a lower level in the operational group model.</p>

    <p>The report Daily Loss Summary needs to be configured. Planned numbers are taken from Facility Class 1 Forecast and Actuals are taken from the stream which is connected to a dedicated stream set. If you use Sub Area as the Daily Deferment Level, then you must configure user exit package UE_DAILY_DEFERMENT.</p>

    <p>The first column in the report &quot;Daily Deferment Summary&quot; is configurable by changing the code_text for the right code where code_type=&rsquo; DAILY_DEF_SUM_LABEL&rsquo; (EC Codes BF)</p>
