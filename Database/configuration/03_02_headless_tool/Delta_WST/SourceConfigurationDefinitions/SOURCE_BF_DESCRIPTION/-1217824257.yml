  DESCRIPTION: <p>Some operations, like LNG Export terminals, may require more flexibility than the Daily and Sub Daily Sales Nomination business functions. For instance, a nomination must be valid until there is a new nomination. This business function allows nominations to be entered on a valid from basis. The nominations can be valid for multiple days, or there can be multiple nominations within one day.</p><p>This business function contains four data sections. The first data section will show you the nomination valid at the selected date in the navigator. If there are multiple renominations on that date, then only the latest will be listed.</p><p>The second data section gives the user the ability to enter a daily comment for the system. This comment is automatically instantiated every night.</p><p>The third data section will list nominations on other nomination points connected to the selected Nomination location in first data section. Similar to the first data section, it is the nomination valid at the selected date in the navigator that will be shown.</p><p>If there are multiple renominations within one production day, then the last data section will list these. Nominations where valid from date falls within the production day selected in the navigator will be listed.</p>
