  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The Business function allows the Transport Operator user to control
    the Allocation process.</p><p>The normal use of this screen is to view currently
    measured energy exit point both calculated and reported.</p><p>The screen should
    show both current and previous reported Allocation. The 1st Data section will
    show metered quantity. The 2nd Data section will show scheduled nominations on
    the selected meter.</p><p>Calculate Button: to calculate values and how they are
    calculated this must be defined by each individual implementation in a Calculation
    Rule etc.</p><p>This screen has been designed in such manner that it can be extended
    to support other types of energy allocation processes in the future, including
    other allocation principles than pro-rata and swing/OBA, allocation to other parties
    than shippers.</p><p>Project Implementation:<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>The
    applicable exit point and day in the upper table will be highlighted in red. By
    selecting a longer date range in the navigator, the user can easily spot revisions
    for several days at once.</li><li>The highlighting in the upper table indicates
    when the measured quantities have changed since last reported allocation for that
    day or when the initial allocation results for the day have not been reported
    yet. Similar highlighting in the allocation results table indicates which of the
    currently allocated quantities have changed since last reported quantities&nbsp;(note:
    all quantities will always be highlighted initially, since the allocation method
    is pro-rata, however reporting the quantities to each contract, will make the
    highlighting disappear, one contract at the time).</li><li>This screen allows
    the user to (re)calculate and (re)send allocation reports to the users. Sending
    a report to a user will cause the Current Allocation for that contract to be copied
    to Reported Allocation, discarding the previously Reported Allocation quantities.</li></ul></p><p>To
    use this business functions it is a requirement that the TARGET can be found in
    a navigation model, and that the target is the owner of the data in the CLASS.
    Mandatory arguments which are needed in the url are CLASS and SUB_CLASS. The navigation
    model can be forced by the project by using NAV_MODEL argument.</p><p>The Business
    function supports profiling on Meter, grouping Meter objects that belong to a
    certain profile. But profiling does not work on two different objects eg having
    Delivery Point and Meter using profile Mechanism; only one type of object can
    use profiling at each screen.</p>'
