  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>BOE Conversion screen</strong> defines the BOE conversion
    factors to be used.</p><p>The conversion can be done on three different levels:
    <strong>Country</strong> as the highest level, <strong>Node</strong> and <strong>Field</strong>
    as the lowest level. Lower levels will always override higher level.<br>If any
    BOE units are configured on a Stream Item, the instantiation will pick up these
    factors and apply them to applicable quantities records.</p> <p>The screen is
    divided into these sections:</p> <p>  <strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Navigator</strong>  </p><p>Section
    where Year and Conversion level have to be chosen.</p><p><strong style="color:
    rgb(0, 102, 204);">Master Section</strong></p><p>Section shows the latest version
    of the object for the selected Year.<br>If there is no version starting in the
    year given by the Year set in the Navigator then the newest version having a version
    start date prior to this year is listed.</p><p>The Master section is read-only
    for all data elements except the End Date, so for changing the actual conversion
    factors and UOM FROM the user has to set the year selector such that the version
    in question is listed in the Detail section. A side-effect of this is that the
    user will not be able to change the Code / Name / Product / (Country/Field/Node)
    once it has been set.</p><p><u>Note:</u> It is NOT allowed to add a New Version
    for a Daytime where there is already one, i.e. when adding a New Version of the
    object the version Daytime has to be AFTER the latest existing one. If the user
    needs to add a New Version <em>in between</em> then the user has to delete the
    versions having Version Date after the one you want to add, and then add the New
    Version. Then add back the ones just deleted.</p><p><u>Also note:</u> if the user
    set an end-date to the object then it is not allowed to add new versions.</p><p><strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Details Section</strong></p><p>Section shows
    all versions having a version start date after the 1st of January of the Year
    set in the navigator.</p>   <p>The BOE conversion will take the quantity given
    by the UOM FROM unit and MULTIPLY with the Factor to get to the BOE number.</p>  <p>  <u>Example:
    </u>  </p>   <p>BOE factor = 40<br>From UOM = MJ.<br>MJ quantity number for the
    given Stream Item: = 2.000 MJ<br>BOE Unit for the given Stream Item: KBOE<br>Then
    the KBOE number will be 2.000 X 40 X 0.001 = 80 KBOE.</p><p><u>Note</u> : BOE
    unit in use for the Stream Item may be BOE | KBOE | MBOE | GBOE. The unit conversion
    will take the actual BOE unit at the Stream Item into account when doing the conversion
    as illustrated in the example above.</p>'
