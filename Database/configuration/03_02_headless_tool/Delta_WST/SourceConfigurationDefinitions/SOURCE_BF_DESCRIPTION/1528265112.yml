  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>BOE Conversion screen</strong>    defines the BOE conversion
    factors to be used.</p><p>    <u>The conversion can be done on three different
    levels: </u><br>    <strong>- Country</strong>    as the highest level,<br>    <strong>-
    Node</strong>    and<br>    <strong>- Field</strong>    as the lowest level.<br>    Lower
    levels will always override higher level.</p><p>    If any BOE units are configured
    on a Stream Item, the instantiation will    pick up these factors and apply them
    to applicable quantities records.</p><p>    <u> The screen is divided into these
    sections: </u></p><p>    <strong><em>- Navigator</em></strong><br>    Section
    where Year and Conversion level have to be chosen.</p><p>    <strong><em>- Master
    Section</em></strong><br>    Section shows the latest version of the object for
    the selected Year.<br>    If there is no version starting in the year given by
    the Year set in the    Navigator then the newest version having a version start
    date prior to this    year is listed.<br>    The Master section is read-only for
    all data elements except the End Date,    so for changing the actual conversion
    factors and UOM FROM the user has to    set the year selector such that the version
    in question is listed in the    Detail section.<br>    <u>Note:</u>    a side-effect
    of this is that the user will not be able to change the Code    / Name / Product
    / (Country/Field/Node) once it has been set.<br>    <u>Also note:</u>    It is
    NOT allowed to add a New Version for a Daytime where there is already    one,
    i.e. when adding a New Version of the object the version Daytime hasto be AFTER
    the latest existing one. If the user needs to add a New Version    <em>in between</em>
    then the user has to delete the versions having Version    Date after the one
    you want to add, and then add the New Version. Then add    back the ones just
    deleted.<br>    <u>Also note:</u>    if the user set an end-date to the object
    then it is not allowed to add new    versions.</p><p>    <strong><em>- Detail
    Section</em></strong><br>    Section shows all versions having a version start
    date after the 1st of    January of the Year set in the navigator.</p><p>    The
    BOE conversion will take the quantity given by the UOM FROM unit and    MULTIPLY
    with the Factor to get to the BOE number.<br>    <u>Example: </u><br>    BOE factor
    = 40<br>    From UOM = MJ.<br>    MJ quantity number for the given Stream Item:
    = 2.000 MJ<br>    BOE Unit for the given Stream Item: KBOE<br>    Then the KBOE
    number will be 2.000 X 40 X 0.001 = 80 KBOE.</p><p>    <u>Note</u>    : BOE unit
    in use for the Stream Item may be BOE | KBOE | MBOE | GBOE. The    unit conversion
    will take the actual BOE unit at the Stream Item into    account when doing the
    conversion as illustrated in the example above.</p>'
