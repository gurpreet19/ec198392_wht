    what Stream Items to be included to the selected HCB    System.<br>    Stream
    Items are used in the HCB Calculations and to create HCB reports    holding monthly
    and daily values.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">    The HCB (Hydrocarbon
    Balance) is a feature for giving an overview of the    whole value chain in terms
    of hydrocarbons taking into account production,    inventory, fuel/flare, injection,
    sales and purchases values.<br>    HCB is a key component of EC Revenue functionality.
    It is the means by    which quantities collected through each of the modules and
    are compared for    consistency, on a daily, monthly, or other period basis.<br>    Although
    the quantities may be registered through any of the transactional    modules,
    the HCB functionality belongs to QTY, since this is where all    Stream Item Values
    ultimately reside.</span></p><p>    <u>The screen is divided into two sections:</u></p><p><strong><em>HCB
