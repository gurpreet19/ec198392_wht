  DESCRIPTION: <p>For all parties entitled to lift from any of the storage systems defined, one or more accounts must exist. The account is just like a bank account &ndash; one can insert and&nbsp;withdraw from the account, and the purpose of the account handling is exactly to keep full records of what has been inserted and withdrawn.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, for each storage system, the account status provides an overview at lifter level and for all associated accounts and their positions at start of month&nbsp;(opening balance) and end of month (closing balance).</p><p>The Estimated Monthly Account Status business function will for each lifting account show planned (or official if available) opening balance, production share, lifted&nbsp;quantity, adjustments and closing balance. The opening balance is equal to the closing balance from previous month. All other fields are calculated. Typically,&nbsp;current month will be a mixture of official and planned data. Future data will typically be planned numbers, while historical data will be official numbers.</p><p>The main purpose for this business function is to give the scheduler an overview of the Lifting Account availability.</p><p>Note that if the Storage type on storage is &lsquo;Import&rsquo; then the calculation for closing balance is reversed. Meaning that lifting&rsquo;s come into the storage and forecast/official numbers goes out of the storage.</p>
