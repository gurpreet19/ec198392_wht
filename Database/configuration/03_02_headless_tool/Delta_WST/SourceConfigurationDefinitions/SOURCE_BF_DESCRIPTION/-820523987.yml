  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>

    <p>A well in EC is the physical string located at the surface or seabed. There is a quite extensive list of screens in EC for registering data against wells.</p>
    <p>A well in EC will only have one single fluid flow tubing head with associated instrumentation.  If there are two or more fluid flow tubing heads with separate instrumentation sets, they should be configured as two or more wells sharing the same well hole.</p>

    <p>Examples of data that can be relevant to register or calculate for a well in EC:</p>

    <p>-  well head sensor data like temperature, pressure and choke position</p>
    <p>-  well bottom hole sensor data like temperature and pressure</p>
    <p>-  well rate data, multiphase metering, gas lift data, pump data</p>
    <p>-  production tests and test results.</p>
    <p>-  theoretical production and injection, volume or mass</p>
    <p>-  allocated production or injection, volume or mass</p>

    <p>One or many wells can belong to a well hole (see separate class for well hole).</p>
    <p>Wells can be split into one or more well bores (see separate class definition for well bores).</p>
    <p>Well bores in turn can be split into one or more Well Bore Intervals (see separate class definition for well bore intervals).</p>
    <p>Wells are not directly connected to a reservoir zone, they are only connected to well bores and well bore intervals.</p>
    <p>The Well Bore Interval, on the other hand, can be connected to a reservoir Block / Formation -combination.</p>
    <p>This subsurface volume in turn can be connected to a Quality stream with reference values describing the fluid properties for the resident reservoir fluid.</p>

    <p>A well must belong to facility class 1 in the operational group model. The relation below well level is not covered by the group model as it is static. There are fixed relations from well down to reservoir zone.</p>

    <p>When updating start date or end date on an existing well, the following classes will have its start date and end date synchronized to this well:</p>
    <p>-  Well Bore</p>
    <p>-  Well Bore Split</p>
    <p>-  Well Bore Interval</p>
    <p>-  Well Bore Interval Split</p>
    <p>-  Well Hole</p>

    <p>Note that the following must be fulfilled to update the start date:</p>
    <p>-  None of the object classes can have more than one version.</p>
    <p>-  All connected objects must have an end date that is higher (or empty) than the given start date of the well.</p>
    <p>-  If the Well is connected to a Well Hole, it is not possible to move the start date to be greater than Well Hole&rsquo;s start date.</p>

    <p>The following must be fulfilled to update the end date:</p>
    <p>-  None of the object classes can have more than one version.</p>
    <p>All connected objects must have a start date that is lower than the given end date of the well.</p>
