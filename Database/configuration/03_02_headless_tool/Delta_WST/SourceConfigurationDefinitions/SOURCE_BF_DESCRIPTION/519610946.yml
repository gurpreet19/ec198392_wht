  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This business function is used to generate and upload cargo documents.
    Both generated and uploaded documents can be downloaded from this screen. The
    cargo&nbsp;documents setup is done in Document Instruction (CP.0013). This is
    typically done by the scheduler in cargo planning screens.</p><p>Before the Carrier
    leaves, the cargo documents must be printed and sent with the Carrier. A signed
    copy is typically kept on the terminal.<br />When selecting a nomination the list
    of generated documents will be listed in the last section. If no documents have
    been generated, the &lsquo;Generate&rsquo; button can be&nbsp;pressed. After the
    documents are generated the download button can be used to get and view a generated
    document. To bundle a set of documents together the&nbsp;&lsquo;Download PDFs&rsquo;
    button can be used. Only the selected rows will be merged.</p><p>Use the &lsquo;Document
    Set&rsquo; drop-down to generate a sub set of the total documents configured in
    the &lsquo;Document Instruction&rsquo; / &lsquo;Document Receivers&rsquo;. Typical
    usage of&nbsp;this feature is setting up some documents to be generated &lsquo;pre-arrival&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;on arrival&rsquo; and &lsquo;post arrival&rsquo; of a carrier.</p><p>Third-party
    documents can be uploaded on either a nomination or on the cargo itself. The last
    section of the screen contains two tabs, Cargo documents and Other&nbsp;Documents,
    each holding designated documents. Supported document upload formats can be configured
    using the system property &quot;Allowed File Extensions for Cargo Documents Upload&quot.
    Only pdf files can be merged.</p><p>The tabs in this screen has been enhanced
    to support optional hiding of &quot;Other Document&quot tab, see Maintain System
    Settings / Custom Settings and modify the property called&nbsp;Cargo Doc - &quot;Other
    Document&quot tab. A value of True or null will make the tab appear, False will
    hide the tab. Changing this value will require a restart/flush to take immediate&nbsp;effect.
    This also support to show all parcels independent of the selection made in parcels-section,
    turn this feature on by setting the system setting Cargo Doc -&nbsp;List All to
    True. This will normally require that the class is updated to show parcel as a
    column.</p><p>To display a message with the option of ok or cancel there is a
    system setting called: Cargo Doc Generate - Confirmation Message. This property
    should be a text&nbsp;which will be displayed to the end-user upon clicking the
    Generate button.</p><p>System setting Cargo Doc Generate - Receipt List is a text
    list of Message Contact Codes of the form: &lsquo;RECIPIENT1&rsquo;,&rsquo;RECIPIENT2&rsquo;,..
    which will impose that only&nbsp;the documents for this/these receipients will
    generated regardless of the complete document instruction.</p><p>When using an
    external report generation system, there exists an option to generate the documents
    for the individual parcels as a scheduled task, this can result in&nbsp;a major
    performance increase if there is a cluster of servers used to generate reports.
    Check out the boolean system setting Cargo Doc Generate &ndash; Scheduled.</p><p>The
    column can be custom sorting by sending the COLUMN_SORT and SORT_TYPE in the url.
    The default sorting are by Daytime descending.</p>'
