  DESCRIPTION: <p>Demurrage is a fine or penalty that the ship or the terminal may incur if the lifting cannot be completed within the designated loading window. Normally the term&nbsp;Demurrage is specifically used when there is a claim from the shipper towards the terminal when the shippers allowed the terminal does not meet laytime. Similarly,&nbsp;the term EBO (Excess Berth Occupancy) is used when there is a claim from the terminal towards the shipper when the shipper exceeds the allowed laytime. Under&nbsp;such circumstances a demurrage calculation may incur which uses information from the time sheet and defined acceptable lay-times for the various steps. The&nbsp;excess time is then subject to a demurrage rate resulting in a demurrage claim.</p><p>The Demurrage business function presents the user with the necessary information to handle the demurrage or EBO situation that may arise during loading of&nbsp;product at the Terminals. The screen provides the user with available information for calculating demurrage, but with the option of entering manual adjustments at&nbsp;several levels. The Calculated Claim value is not the official value, but rather a basis for the official number, entered in the Claim field.<br />Prior to using the Demurrage business function, typically cargo activity timesheet (TO.0001) is completed, cargo delays (TO.0002) are entered and carrier laytime&nbsp;(CP.0003) is set.</p><p>The user will then decide how to calculate commenced laytime. This includes selecting what activity that starts (commences) the laytime and end (completes) the&nbsp;laytime. Based on this information, lay-time is calculated. For the specific cargo, the Laytime Allowance for the carrier is defined. If another laytime allowance is&nbsp;agreed, the defined value can be overridden in the &ldquo;Accepted Lay-time Allowance&rdquo; field.</p><p>If the official demurrage claim (Claim field) differs from the calculated claim, the Comments field should be used for explanation.</p><p>Note that if any of the Lifting Activity Codes (CO.2005) is configured wrongly or dates are missing in the Cargo Activity Timesheet (TO.0001), the calculations will&nbsp;return null.</p>
