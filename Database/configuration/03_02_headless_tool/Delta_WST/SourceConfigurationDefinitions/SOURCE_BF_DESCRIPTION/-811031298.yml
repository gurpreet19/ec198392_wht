  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This Business Function is part of the Business Process to gather and QA sub daily well gas injection data. It should be used when SCADA systems provide records each 2nd hour / hourly / 30min or at other fixed intervals.</p>

    <p>If the original data has occasional &quot;missing rows&quot; (that is, not every half hour when the fixed interval is 30 min), the &quot;<em>Generate Missing Rows</em>&quot; -button will insert any missing rows so that every half hour is accounted for. For these newly inserted rows, an existing period&rsquo;s data will be used as the row&rsquo;s initial value. EC will support copy forward, copy backwards and interpolate methods for generating missing row field values; the customer may select the desired method from a screen popup list.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Aggregate Current&quot; &ndash;button will aggregate all sub-daily gas injection well data (except calculated read only fields) for the day and well chosen in the navigator.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Aggregate Facility All&quot; &ndash;button will aggregate all sub-daily gas injection well data (except calculated read only fields) for all wells for the day and facility chosen in the navigator.</p>

    <p>If aggregation of sub daily data for all gas injection wells in one go is desirable this must be defined as a dbms_scheduler job and is to be implemented by the individual project.</p>

    <p>The <strong>navigator </strong>section enables the selection of specific date for which the injection well sub day measurement data will be displayed. The navigator is based on the configured group model down to the well level. All levels are mandatory but may be defaulted. Navigator selections are applied when pressing the [GO] &ndash;button. There should be a white line between the navigator and data section 1.</p>

    <p><strong>Data section 1 </strong>has two buttons and a dropdown that enables the operator to fill inn blank records or trigger an aggregation of sub-day data to daily representative values.</p>

    <p><a section 2 </strong>lists all sub day measurement data available for the well and date selected in the navigator. The section may also include calculated read only fields like theoretical sub daily volumes.</p>

    <p>V_IWEL_SUB_DAY_STATUS view is available and it shows the injection data for any kind of injection well in a single view.</p>
