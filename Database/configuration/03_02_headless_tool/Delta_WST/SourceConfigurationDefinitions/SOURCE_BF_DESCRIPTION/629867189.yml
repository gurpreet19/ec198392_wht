  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This business function is used to generate and upload cargo documents.
    Both generated and uploaded documents can be downloaded from this screen. The
    cargo&nbsp;documents setup is done in Document Instruction (CP.0013). This is
    typically done by the scheduler in cargo planning screens.</p><p>Before the Carrier
    leaves, the cargo documents must be printed and sent with the Carrier. A signed
    copy is typically kept on the terminal.<br />When selecting a nomination the list
    of generated documents will be listed in the last section. If no documents have
    been generated, the &lsquo;Generate&rsquo; button can be&nbsp;pressed. After the
    documents are generated the download button can be used to get and view a generated
    document. To bundle a set of documents together the&nbsp;&lsquo;Download PDFs&rsquo;
    button can be used. Only the selected rows will be merged.</p><p>Use the &lsquo;Document
    Set&rsquo; drop-down to generate a sub set of the total documents configured in
    the &lsquo;Document Instruction&rsquo; / &lsquo;Document Receivers&rsquo;. Typical
    usage of&nbsp;this feature is setting up some documents to be generated &lsquo;pre-arrival&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;on arrival&rsquo; and &lsquo;post arrival&rsquo; of a carrier.</p><p>Third-party
    documents can be uploaded on either a nomination or on the cargo itself. Supported
    document upload formats can be configured using the system property &quot;Allowed
    File Extensions for Upload Cargo Documents Parcel&quot. Only pdf files can be
    merged.</p><p>To display a message with the option of ok or cancel there is a
    system setting called: Cargo Doc Generate - Confirmation Message. This property
    should be a text&nbsp;which will be displayed to the end-user upon clicking the
    Generate button.</p><p>System setting Cargo Doc Generate - Receipt List is a text
    list of Message Contact Codes of the form: &lsquo;RECIPIENT1&rsquo;,&rsquo;RECIPIENT2&rsquo;,..
    which will impose that only&nbsp;the documents for this/these receipients will
    generated regardless of the complete document instruction.</p><p>When using an
    external report generation system, there exists an option to generate the documents
    for the individual parcels as a scheduled task, this can result in&nbsp;a major
    performance increase if there is a cluster of servers used to generate reports.
    Check out the boolean system setting Cargo Doc Generate &ndash; Scheduled.</p>'
