  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to display and update prices for a contract with dimensions.</p><p>This business function assumes the prices are calculated by the EC calculation engine, typically based on price indices. This would typically be a scheduled job, or&nbsp;can be initiated from the Price Calculation (PR.0008) business function. The calculated prices can be adjusted in the &ldquo;Adjusted Price&rdquo; column. The price value&nbsp;available externally (reporting, EC Revenue, etc) will be &ldquo;Adjusted Price&rdquo; if this is available, else it will be &ldquo;Calculated Price&rdquo;.</p><p>The user selects the required month(s) and object in the navigator. A contract is selected in the first section and all prices that are valid for the day.</p><p>General prices for individual products, i.e. not related to a contract, cannot be handled here. The business function Product Price List (PR.0002) should be used.</p><p>For details about Price Object, Price Concept and Price Element, please read the EC Sales Configuration Manual.</p><p>The implementation of this business function is done in a generic manner. That means that it can be used to show many different price dimensions. The product&nbsp;comes with a set of predefined treeview entries, but the project can add more as needed.</p>
