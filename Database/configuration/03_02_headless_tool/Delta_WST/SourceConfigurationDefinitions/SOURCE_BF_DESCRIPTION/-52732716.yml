  DESCRIPTION: '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"> <em> <u> For the EC Financial
    Documents there are 3 key dates that EC can determine automatically based on configuration:
    </u> <br>       <strong> - Document Date </strong> (Document Date Term screen
    - BF CD.0107), <br> <strong>- Document Received Date </strong> (Document Received
    Term screen - BF CD.0108), <br>    <strong> - Payment Date </strong> (Payment
    Term screen - BF CD.0023).</em></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
    <em>EC uses a concept called Date Term to be able to determine these dates. <u>
    This works as follows: </u> </em></span></p><p>  <img src="/onlinehelp/img?type=description&bfDescNo=CD.0023&imgNo=2&dataLevel=2&pfdrid_c=true"
    class="ecImg" style="font-size: 10pt;"></p><p>    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0,
    153);"><em><u>The logic contains 2 main elements:</u></em></span></p><p>    <span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><em><strong>1. Starting Point</strong> - the date
    the Term is calculated from to get to the Target Date.</em></span></p><p><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"> <em>The Starting Point is a date that can be given
    by another date in the financial document, such as Document Date, Bill of Lading
    Date, etc. The setting of the starting point is disconnected from the Date Term
    object itself. This way the same Date Term can be used with different starting
    points. The starting point is defined for each Document Setup for the various
    Date Terms by the Document Date Base Code / Document Received Date Base Code /
    Payment Term Date Base Code attribute which can be set to Document Date, Bill
    of Lading Date, etc.</em></span></p><p>    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><em><strong>2.
    Term itself</strong> - the rule to get to the Target Date (Document Date / Document
    Received Date / Payment Date).</em></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0,
    153);"><em> The Term has various methods to get to the Target Date which may include
    Calendar Days vs Business Days. <br>In case the Date Term includes Business Days
    then a Calendar object needs to be defined.</em></span></p><p>    <strong style="font-size:
    large;">Payment Term screen</strong> is used to manage all the Payment Terms available
    to the system. <br>The Payment Term is used for calculating a Payment Due Date
    for a Document.</p><p>- Each Payment Term is defined by a set of attributes giving
    them different qualities. <br>- Payment Term can also be configured using the
    EC Framework calculation engine. In that case the Calc Rule Payment Terms type
    must be selected.</p>'
