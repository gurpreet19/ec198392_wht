  DESCRIPTION: <p>This is a generic maintain screen; see description of generic maintain screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p><p>Gas is delivered and measured at delivery points. There can be several delivery points specified in one contract, but in some cases there is a one-to-one relationship&nbsp;between gas sales contract and delivery point, meaning that the metered gas quantity will equal the delivery under that contract. In other cases, the actual metered&nbsp;quantity will need to be split down to multiple sales contracts at the same delivery point (referred to as &ldquo;Sales Allocation&rdquo;).</p><p>The Delivery Point screens are used to create new delivery points, and to maintain attributes of the created delivery points.</p>
