  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function covers two configuration screens for lifting accounts. There is one for creating lifting accounts, and one for maintaining existing lifting<br />accounts.</p><p>A Lifting Account is the nomination point and where the availability is calculated. A lifting account can represent a producer, shipper, customer etc. or a group of&nbsp;these. How this is configured is up to the implementing project, but what is important is that there is only one Lifting Account on one nomination, and one lifting&nbsp;account availability balance. A more detailed accounting balance can be required, and should be held in the &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; balance.</p><p>A lifting account is always associated to a storage (product).</p><p><strong>Entitlement</strong><br />The typical Lifting Accounts is per company or per company and profit centre. A company owns a share of what is produced into a storage. The availability increases&nbsp;with production and decreases with lifting&rsquo;s.</p><p>Profit Centre is not mandatory. This means that you can have accounts where only a storage and company is selected and accounts with a profit centre. Profit&nbsp;Centre is typically used when the origin of production is required. It is not allowed to have two accounts where one account have only company, and the other have&nbsp;the same company and profit centre. The profit Centre information can be held in the &lsquo;Ownership&rsquo; Balance.</p><p>The production share (availability increase) is typically calculated from EC Production.</p><p><strong>Contract</strong><br />Contract based lifting&rsquo;s means that the availability is calculated based on Contract attributes (e.g. from a sales agreement). The simples example is that the Lifting&nbsp;Account increase is calculated based on DCQ (Daily Contract Quantity). The Lifting Account can be seen as the relation between Contract and Product.</p><p>The Lifting Account is associated with the Contract. Company and Profit Centre will typically be empty.</p><p>If there are a Contract between a vendor and a customer that is for more than one product it is recommended to split this in two contracts with a relation to a parent&nbsp;contract. See example below:</p><p><strong>Lifting Agreement</strong><br />Since some owners (companies) are so small it will take them too long to get enough to send a Carrier, they have Lifting Agreements with one (or more) of the larger&nbsp;owners.</p><p>Example one:<br />This alternative will handle that two companies are not always lifting together or if there have to be two (or more) nominations on a cargo. They will have a separate&nbsp;lifting account balance.</p><p>Two (ore more) Lifting Accounts is set up against the different companies. The lifting accounts are associated to the same contract that will hold the split in Contract&nbsp;Parties for the different companies. When the lifting program is being generated it will have to consider the agreement and create two nominations against the lifting&nbsp;accounts. Further, this will result in two sets of documents.</p><p>The calculations for the increase will have to just add the production to the different accounts</p><p>Example two:<br />If two (or more) companies always lift together they should be set up as one Lifting Account, where the availability is merged together, at least from the nomination&nbsp;perspective. A separate ownership balance can be kept for reporting purposes.</p><p>The Lifting Account will in this case be set up against a Contract. The configuration in Contract Parties will define the split between the companies. This split can be&nbsp;overridden on each specific nomination. This result in one nomination and one set of documents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
