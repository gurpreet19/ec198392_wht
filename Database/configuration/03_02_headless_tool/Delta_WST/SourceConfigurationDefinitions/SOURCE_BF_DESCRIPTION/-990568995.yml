  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This business function is used to search truck tickets records. It will also take you the related truck tickets screens including Truck Ticket - Single Transfer, Truck Ticket - Single Transfer - Objects, Truck Ticket - Single Transfer - Objects From, Truck Ticket - Load To Wells, Truck Ticket - Load From Wells, Truck Ticket - Single Load Multiple Offload, and Event Tank Status - Dip and Export (Disposition tab) business functions.</p>

    <p>In the navigator, there is a free text field which is used as the search target string. By default, EC is shipped with search criteria on Ticket Number, From Object and To Object. Truck Ticket records are then filtered against Ticket Number, From Object and To Object that matches the defined search target string. User can also specify the date range for the records to be filtered.</p>

    <p>The search is not case sensitive in this context and no wildcards needed.</p>

    <p>In addition, EC also provides user with the flexibility to re-define the search criteria on other truck ticket attributes, such as EVENT_NO. Search criteria can be reduced to a single attribute or can be increased to more than one attribute, but it has to be delimited with a keyboard character &ldquo;|&rdquo;, which is the vertical bar (or DOS pipe character).</p>

    <p>Object data section below will list all the truck tickets for the defined search criteria matched with (or like) the search target string.</p>

    <p>By choosing a truck ticket record, it will show you the active group models associated with the selected truck ticket for both From Object and To Object. It will also populate the group model relation for the objects.</p>

    <p>By selecting a related business function in Business Function data section and pressing the &lsquo;Go to BF&rsquo; button, a new window will be opened with the navigator values pre-populated based on selected truck tickets.</p>
