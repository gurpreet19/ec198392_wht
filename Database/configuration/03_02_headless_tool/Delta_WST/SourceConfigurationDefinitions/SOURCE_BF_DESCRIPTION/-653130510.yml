  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen maps data between values in the file one tries to import data from and values in EC. An example can be if you have a well in EC called AS1_Well_001, while in the file you try to import it's called AM1. By adding a mapping in this screen, EC Import will read the value from the file as AM1, and convert it to AS1_Well_001 before it tries to insert it into EC.</p>
