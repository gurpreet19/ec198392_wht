  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This screen is a generic screen that shows all available daily stream data for the stream and month specified in the screen navigator. Note that this screen does not have a standard operational navigator based on the group model concept but rather just a month field and a stream dropdown. The Stream dropdown is not mandatory. This screen takes a daily stream oriented data class as parameter.</p>

    <p>That means that a project can set up several screens instances based on this screen template only by re-using the screen but specifying different daily stream data classes as input parameter to the screen.</p>

    <p>The screen will only show the streams part of the streamset defined in the stream data set used in the WHERE clause of the data class.</p>

    <p>In the screenshot above, the screen have been set up to use the same data class and stream set as used by the standard EC screen.</p>
