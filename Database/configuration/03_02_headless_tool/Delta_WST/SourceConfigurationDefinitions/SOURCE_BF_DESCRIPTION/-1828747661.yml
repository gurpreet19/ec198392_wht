  DESCRIPTION: "<p>\t<strong>Period Document screen</strong> is used to enable processing\
    \ of Financial Documents more efficient and less time consuming. This screen is\
    \ also known as the PDG screen (Period Document Generation). <br>- The manual\
    \ creation of invoices/documents is already present in Document General screen\
    \ (BF SP.0016). <br>- The main difference is that this screen will automatically\
    \ create documents, transactions and line items and populate these with quantities\
    \ and monetary values based on the periodic quantity data fetched from the interface\
    \ table (IFAC_SALES_QTY). This table can be populated with data from EC Sales\
    \ Contract Accounts or from external sources. When periodic quantity data is put\
    \ into the interface table it is at the same time made available for processing/invoicing\
    \ by EC Revenue using this BF<br>- Most of the operations needed for the generated\
    \ Documents can be performed from this BF, including updates of Quantities, Prices,\
    \ Dates, Exchange Rates, etc. (as well as the detail popups that allow working\
    \ with more detail for the documents and transactions as well as being able to\
    \ handle the distributions between assets and companies). Still there are some\
    \ operations that are not available from this screen - for these operations please\
    \ use the Business Functions listed under the EC Revenue -> Financial Transactions\
    \ -> Process.</p><h2>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153);\">Navigator</strong></h2>The\
    \ purpose of the navigator of this screen is to filter out the Documents to display\
    \ in the screen.<br>Also note the values of the navigator will be used when executing\
    \ the 'Process' button which will process any interfaced data. For more details\
    \ on this please see separate section below.<p></p><p>\t<u>The navigator of this\
    \ screen has the following elements:</u>\t<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- From Date:</em>\t\
    </strong> Any document having a Document Date equal to or greater than this date\
    \ will be listed.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- To Date:</em>\t</strong> Any documents\
    \ having a Document Date less that this date will be listed. Note that any documents\
    \ having Document Date equal to this date will NOT be listed.<br>\t<strong>\t\t\
    <em>- Business Unit:</em>\t</strong> Any documents belonging to a Contract where\
    \ the Contract Area of the Contract is linked to the selected Business Unit will\
    \ be listed. This filter is mandatory.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- Contract Area:</em>\t\
    </strong> Any documents belonging to a Contract linked to the selected Contract\
    \ Area will be listed. This filter is optional.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- Contract:</em>\t\
    </strong> Any documents belonging to the selected Contract will be listed. This\
    \ filter is optional.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- Document List:</em>\t</strong> Any\
    \ documents where the Document Setup matches the Document Setups defined in the\
    \ selected Document List will be listed. This filter is optional.<br>\t<strong>\t\
    \t<em>- Financial Code:</em>\t</strong> Any documents belonging to a Contract\
    \ where the Financial Code of the Contract matches the selected Financial Code\
    \ will be listed. This filter is optional.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- Contract:</em>\t\
    </strong> Any documents having Document Level matching the selected Document Level\
    \ will be listed. This filter is optional.</p><h2>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(0,\
    \ 0, 153);\">Tab Documents</strong></h2><p>The Documents Tab is the most important\
    \ part of this BF. This tab has functionality as follows:</p><p>\t<strong>Data\
    \ section: Current Periods</strong>\t <br>- The Booking and Reporting periods\
    \ in EC are per area, i.e. Financial Code like Product Sales, Product Purchases,\
    \ Tariff Income, Tariff Cost, and Journal Entry. <br>- In addition there are Booking\
    \ and Reporting periods for the EC Revenue Quantity module and the Inventory module.\
    \ <br>- The current periods section at the top of the 'Documents' tab will list\
    \ the current open Booking and Reporting periods for the EC Revenue Quantity module\
    \ and the area corresponding to the Financial Code of the selected contract.</p><p>\t\
    <strong>Button   <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 153, 0);\">Process</span>\t</strong>\t\
    \ <br>The Process button will read the selected process from the data field to\
    \ the left of the button and execute as follows: <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- Selected\
    \ process is Standard:</em>\t </strong>\t<br>The Standard process is to look into\
    \ the interface table (IFAC_SALES_QTY) and process (i.e. generate new documents\
    \ or updating existing ones) any un-processed records found that match the settings\
    \ for Business Area / Contract Area / Contract / Financial Code in the filter\
    \ navigator. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- Selected process is PPA Price:</em>\t</strong>\t\
    \ <br>The PPA Price process will generate correction documents for contracts filtered\
    \ by the navigator values where there are new prices in the price lists compared\
    \ to the prices used in the existing documents.</p><p>\t<strong>Button   <span\
    \ style=\"color: rgb(0, 153, 0);\">Analyse</span>\t</strong>\t <br>Whenever the\
    \ PDG screen is loaded the system performs the <em>Analyse</em> to each of the\
    \ Documents displayed in the screen. This function is also available in the screen\
    \ at the <em>Analyse</em> button.<br>Based on the analysis the system will suggest\
    \ a \"Recommended Action\". This action is displayed in the \"Analysis\" column\
    \ in the table listing the documents.</p><p>\t<u>The \"Analyse\" function performs\
    \ these checks and sets a corresponding \"Analysis\" value if the check fails:</u>\t\
    <br>- Checks that all dates are set<br>- Checks that all QUANTITY Line Items have\
    \ quantities set<br>- Checks if any updated or new quantities have arrived through\
    \ the interface that is different from the current quantities used by the Transactions\
    \ / Line Items<br>- Checks that Line Items requiring a Unit Price has this set<br>-\
    \ Checks if the Unit Price used for a Line Item is the same as the Unit Price\
    \ sitting in the Price table for the given Price Date (if a price has been changed\
    \ and the new price is not in the document yet)<br>- Checks that all Line Items\
    \ have the Pricing Value set <br>- Checks that all Transactions have Exchange\
    \ Rates set as needed according to the various currencies used by the Document.\
    \ <br>- Checks that the Document Status has be set (to either Final or Accrual)<br>-\
    \ If all the checks listed above are passed the system sets the \"Recommended\
    \ Action\" to \"Set to VALID1\" - which means that the Document is ready to be\
    \ validated to the VALID1 level. <br>- Note that the \"Analyze Documents\" function\
    \ is User-Exit enabled for the projects to add their own validation and checks\
    \ to the Document.</p><p>\t<strong>Button   <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 153, 0);\"\
    >Calculate</span>\t</strong>\t <br>The Calculate button will recalculate any Calculated\
    \ Line Items for the selected document by re-running the calculation associated\
    \ with the Line Item.</p><p>\t<strong>Button   <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 153,\
    \ 0);\">Rec Action</span>\t</strong>\t<br>- The result of the Analysis is a Recommended\
    \ Action shown in the Analysis column of the list of documents. <br>Some of these\
    \ actions can be performed by the system, i.e. no user input is required, for\
    \ instance updating prices and quantities in the Document.<br>- The Rec Action\
    \ button will execute the Recommended Action for ALL the documents listed in the\
    \ screen. After the action has been performed to the individual Documents the\
    \ system also runs the \"Analyse\" function again in order to update the \"Recommended\
    \ Action\" / \"Analysis\" for each Document.</p><p>\t<strong>Button   <span style=\"\
    color: rgb(0, 153, 0);\">Document Detail</span>\t</strong>\t <br>The Document\
    \ Detail button will open a popup window for the selected Document. The popup\
    \ will list more details for the selected document as well as the Transactions\
    \ belonging to the Document. <br>The popup will also have some of the buttons\
    \ available in the PDG screen: Analyse / Calculate / Rec Action / Transaction\
    \ Detail. The functionality is the same as described here, but for the selected\
    \ document only.</p><p>\t<strong>Button   <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 153, 0);\"\
    >Transaction Detail</span>\t</strong>\t <br>The Transaction Detail button will\
    \ open a popup window for the selected Transaction of the selected Document. The\
    \ popup will list more details for the selected Transaction. <br>In addition,\
    \ there is a range of features available in this popup. <u> The popup has 8 different\
    \ tabs for managing the selected Transaction. These are: </u>\t <br>\t<strong>\t\
    \t<em> 1. Tab Transaction Distribution</em>\t</strong>\t <br>This tab manages\
    \ the distribution of quantities and monetary values to Profit Centre and Profit\
    \ Centre / Company. For manually created Documents this tab allows for updating\
    \ the quantities. <br>- For Documents based on interfaced data the quantities\
    \ will be read-only as in this case the quantities are controlled by other sources\
    \ - either EC Sales Contract Account data or uploaded data from external systems.\
    \ In both cases, the Comments field is open for edit.<br>- When entering/changing\
    \ quantities at any of the three levels the system will calculate up to the levels\
    \ above and down to the ls below such that the total quantities are always in\
    \ sync. For transactions based on templates with reduced configuration (not distribution\
    \ level is given) there is no split percentage to base the splitting downward\
    \ on, and therefore the quantities MUST be entered at the lowest (company) level\
    \ and they will be summed upward to the transaction level. <u> Note </u> that\
    \ there is room for up to 4 quantity numbers in different units at each level.\
    \ If for instance Qty3 and Qty4 are never used for any Contract these columns\
    \ can be hidden from the screen in order to save space. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>\
    \ 2. Tab Line Item Overview</em>\t</strong>\t<br>The Line Item Overview tab gives\
    \ an overview of all the Line Items for the selected Transaction. It will show\
    \ quantities as well as monetary values for Pricing / Memo / Booking / Local currencies.<br>-\
    \ This tab also lists the exchange rates being used for converting between the\
    \ various currencies in use for the Transaction.<br>- The 'Update Price' button\
    \ will pull the prices from the Price List(s) and re-populate the Line Items with\
    \ the current prices. <br>- This tab also provides functionality for managing\
    \ 'Comments Before Transaction' and 'Comments After Transaction' which will typically\
    \ be printed on the Invoice Hardcopy. Such comments can be added / deleted using\
    \ the Insert / Delete icons on the EC Toolbar.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> 3. Tab Quantity\
    \ Line Items</em>\t</strong>\t<br>This tab provides more details for the Quantity\
    \ type of Line Items of the Transactions. It allows for editing the Line Item\
    \ Description - this is typically printed on the Invoice Hardcopy.<br>- It also\
    \ allows for changing the VAT Code (and thus VAT Rate) for the Line Item.<br>-\
    \ The 'Update Price' button will pull the prices from the Price List(s) and re-populate\
    \ the Line Items with the current prices.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> 4. Tab Fixed Value\
    \ Line Items</em>\t</strong>\t<br>This tab is for managing the 'Fixed Value' type\
    \ of Line Items. The user can modify/delete existing Line Items as well as adding\
    \ new.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> 5. Tab Free Unit Line Items</em>\t</strong>\t<br>This\
    \ tab is for managing the 'Quantity Based - Free Unit' and 'Free Unit Price Object'\
    \ type of Line Items. The user can modify/delete existing Line Items as well as\
    \ adding new. <br>- The 'Update Price' button will pull the prices from the Price\
    \ List(s) and re-populate the Line Items with the current prices. <br>\t<strong>\t\
    \t<em> 6. Tab Percentage Line Items </em>\t</strong>\t<br>This tab is for managing\
    \ the 'Percentage All', 'Percentage Quantity', and 'Percentage Manual' type of\
    \ Line Items. The user can modify/delete existing Line Items as well as adding\
    \ new.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> 7. Tab Interest Line Items </em>\t</strong>\t<br>This\
    \ tab is for managing the 'Interest' type of Line Items. The user can modify/delete\
    \ existing Line Items as well as adding new.<br>\t<u> Note </u> that when the\
    \ period of the interest calculation given by the 'From Date' and the 'To Date'\
    \ is greater than the Compounding Period EC will add additional Interest Line\
    \ Items to cater for the compounding. <br>- The 'Update Interest Line Items' button\
    \ will recalculate the Interest Line Item in terms of updating the Base Amount,\
    \ retrieving Base Rate from Price Index (if configured) and recalculate the full\
    \ value of the Line Item.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> 8. Tab Calculated Line Items </em>\t\
    </strong>\t<br>This is for handling any Calculated Line Items. From this tab the\
    \ Calculation can be kicked off for the Calculated Line Items in the selected\
    \ Transaction.<br>\t<u> Note </u> that this screen doesn't allow for adding or\
    \ deleting any Calculated Line Items to the selected Transaction.</p><p>\t<strong>Button\
    \   <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 153, 0);\">Trace Document</span>\t</strong>\t\
    \ <br>The Trace Document button will open a popup window showing the trace information\
    \ for the selected Document. For more details on how the Tracing works, please\
    \ see online help for Business Function 'Document Tracing'<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>\
    \ 1. Data section: Document List</em>\t</strong>\t <br>This section of the screen\
    \ is in many aspects most important part of the PDG screen. It lists all the Documents\
    \ available according to the Navigator settings. Key data elements for each Document\
    \ are listed. <br>Each Document in the list can be selected and various operations\
    \ can be performed for the selected Document.<br>Please use the 'Document Detail'\
    \ button for more details for the selected Transaction.   <br>\t <strong>\t\t\
    <em> 2. Data section: Transaction List</em>\t</strong>\t<br>This section lists\
    \ all the Transactions for the selected Document. Key data elements for each Transaction\
    \ are listed.<br>\t<u> Note </u> that for each Transaction this screen will show\
    \ the quantity associated with the Transaction and the sum of all monetary values\
    \ for the Transaction - both the monetary values related to the Quantity Line\
    \ Item AND any other Line Items attached to the Transaction.<br>Please use the\
    \ 'Transaction Detail' button for more details for the selected Document.</p><h3>\t\
    <strong>Other features</strong></h3><p>\t<strong>Create Document Manually</strong>\t\
    \ <br>Documents can be created manually by using the Insert icon in the EC Toolbar.\
    \ A new record will be inserted into the Document List and the user will then\
    \ select Contract / Document Setup / Document Date / Document Status / Preceding\
    \ Document (optional).<br>By saving the Document will be generated.</p><p>\t<strong>Insert\
    \ additional Transactions into the Document</strong>\t <br>If there for some reason\
    \ is necessary to add additional Transactions to a Document this can easily be\
    \ done by selecting \"Transaction\" from the Insert button. <br>The user can then\
    \ select among the Transaction Templates defined for the Document Setup in use\
    \ and insert a new, clean Transaction.</p><p>\t<strong>Delete Transactions / Line\
    \ Items from the Document</strong>\t <br>When creating a new Document the system\
    \ will automatically create Transactions according to the Transaction Templates\
    \ defined for the Document Setup used in combination with the actual data interfaced\
    \ from the external system. For a given Document all of these Transactions may\
    \ not be needed, for instance, if there are no quantities delivered for one or\
    \ more of them. In this case, the screen has a function to automatically delete\
    \ all \"Empty Transactions\". A Transaction is considered \"Empty\" when all the\
    \ Line Items of the Transaction are \"Empty\". <u>Line Items are \"Empty\" according\
    \ to these rules: </u></p><p>- Line Item Type = \"Quantity\" Empty if there is\
    \ no quantity<br>- Line Item Type = \"Quantity Based - Free Unit\" Empty if there\
    \ is no quantity <br>- Line Item Type = \"Calculate Qty and Pricing Value\" Empty\
    \ if there is no quantity <br>- Line Item Type = \"Fixed Value\" Empty if there\
    \ is no Pricing Value (monetary value) <br>- Line Item Type = \"Free Unit Price\
    \ Object\" Empty if there is no Pricing Value (monetary value) <br>- Line Item\
    \ Type = \"Interest\" Empty if there is no Pricing Value (monetary value) <br>-\
    \ Line Item Type = \"Percentage All\" Empty if there is no Pricing Value (monetary\
    \ value) <br>- Line Item Type = \"Percentage Quantity\" Empty if there is no Pricing\
    \ Value (monetary value)<br>- Line Item Type = \"Percentage Manual\" Empty if\
    \ there is no Pricing Value (monetary value) <br>- Line Item Type = \"Calculate\
    \ Pricing Value\" Empty if there is no Pricing Value (monetary value) <br>\t<u>\
    \ Note </u> that when EC creates Documents automatically the \"Delete Empty Transactions\"\
    \ is performed as part of the process in order to have the document ready for\
    \ validation.</p><p>\t<strong>User Action</strong>\t<br>For each Document listed\
    \ in the screen, there is a 'User Action' drop-down. By selecting an action item\
    \ and saving EC will perform the selected action.   </p><p>The list of actions\
    \ is configurable, but <u>the standard actions are:</u>\t <br>\t<strong>\t\t <em>\
    \ - Recommended Action: </em>\t</strong> This action will execute the action proposed\
    \ by EC as a result of the Analyse function (see above). <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>\
    \ - Set to Valid 1: </em>\t</strong> This will move the selected document from\
    \ 'Open' state to the 'Valid 1' state. EC will generate all the posting information\
    \ per Line Item when moving a Document to Valid 1 state. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>\
    \ - Set back to Open: </em>\t</strong> This will move the selected document from\
    \ the 'Valid 1' state back to the 'Open' state. EC will delete all the posting\
    \ information per Line Item when moving a Document back to the Open state. <br>\t\
    <strong>\t\t<em> - Update Prices: </em>\t</strong> This will repopulate all the\
    \ Transactions and Line Items of the selected Document with the current values\
    \ of the prices found in the Price Lists and then recalculate the corresponding\
    \ monetary values. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> - Update from I/F: </em>\t</strong>\
    \ This will repopulate all the Transactions and Line Items of the selected Document\
    \ with data from the Interface tables if there are any such new data. <br>\t<strong>\t\
    \t<em> - Update Prices and from I/F: </em>\t</strong> Combination of 'Update Prices'\
    \ and 'Update from I/F' - see above. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> - Delete (no recreate):\
    \ </em>\t</strong> Will delete the selected Document and if the Document was based\
    \ on interfaced data the corresponding interfaced data will have the 'Ignore'\
    \ flag set. When running the Process (see above) any interfaced records set to\
    \ Ignore will not be part of the document processing. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> -\
    \ Delete (and recreate): </em>\t</strong> Will delete the selected Document and\
    \ if the Document was based on interfaced data the corresponding interfaced data\
    \ will be released for re-processing. When running the Process (see above) the\
    \ interfaced records will be part of the document processing. This variant is\
    \ useful when generated document had some errors and the reason for the errors\
    \ can be corrected before generating the document again. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>\
    \ - Delete Empty Transactions: </em>\t</strong> This action will delete all transactions\
    \ considered as 'empty'. Please see section above for more details. <br>\t<strong>\t\
    \t<em> - Delete Empty Line Items: </em>\t</strong> Will delete all empty Line\
    \ Items from the Transactions of the selected Document. This action will at least\
    \ leave one Line Item for the Transaction even if it is 'empty'. Please see section\
    \ above for more details. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- Reverse: </em>\t</strong> Will\
    \ create a Reversal Document for the selected Document. The Document to reverse\
    \ must have status BOOKED in order to be reversed. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> - Re-calculate\
    \ Source Split: </em>\t</strong> Allocation of quantities to Profit Centers can\
    \ be based on a Source Split. This is a dynamical split using one set of numbers\
    \ (Production quantities) to generate a split and then apply this split to the\
    \ Transaction. <br>\t<strong>\t\t<em> - Update Exchange Rates: </em>\t</strong>\
    \ This action will read Exchange Rates from the Exchange Rate tables and repopulate\
    \ all the exchange rates in use by the Document. All monetary values will be re-calculated.</p><p>\t\
    <strong>Number of decimals for Quantity numbers </strong>\t<br>The number of decimals\
    \ for the Quantity 1 - 4 is by default set to 3 decimals. This can be overridden\
    \ for each individual quantity by setting the \"Print UOM Decimals\" attributes\
    \ at the Transaction Template. Note that these attributes are also used by the\
    \ standard Invoice Hardcopy reports coming with the EC product.</p><p>\t<strong>Transaction\
    \ Origin Country and Destination Country</strong>\t<br>The origin country and\
    \ destination country on a transaction come from transaction template. They are\
    \ also changed when updating the delivery point on a transaction. The new value\
    \ will be the country of a   new delivery point. This logic can be overwritten\
    \ using user exits ue_cont_transaction.GetOriginCountryForTrans and ue_cont_transaction\
    \ .GetDestinationCountryForTrans.</p><p>\t<strong>Alternate customer on a document</strong>\t\
    <br>By default, it is not allowed to choose a different customer on a document\
    \ than that chosen for on company split for the template (alternate customer).\
    \ To turn on this feature, tick the checkbox on contract attribute \"Allow Alternative\
    \ Customer\", and enable the class relation FIN_PERIOD_DOCUMENTS.CUSTOMER in screen\
    \ Configuration - System - Class Relations.</p><p>Manually changing is only allowed\
    \ on standalone and manually created documents (Although it can be changed for\
    \ MPD documents processed using the IFAC tables).</p><h2>\t<strong style=\"color:\
