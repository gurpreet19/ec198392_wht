  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The Create Calculation screen is used to define new calculations and add new versions to existing calculations. The screen is also used for basic maintenance like deleting and exporting calculations.</p>

    <p>The actual content of a calculation is not defined in this screen, except for the base type of the calculation (Process Diagram, Equations or Excel Workbook). For more information on calculations in general, calculation types and how the content of a calculation is defined, see the BF <em>Maintain Calculation (CO.1040)</em>.</p>

    <p>The static parameter data section can be used to add additional Engine Parameters. Typically this will be used together with the &ldquo;Proxy&rdquo; Calculation Type, where the parameter(s) can be used to differentiate between periods or phases.</p>
