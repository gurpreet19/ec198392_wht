  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Data Extract by Year screen</strong>    is used to
    create Data Extract documents based on the Data Extract setup object for a given
    time scope which can be a month, a quarter or a full year.<br>    - The Data Extract
    documents will hold data entry data based on the configuration of the tags in
    the Data Extract Setup List screen.<br>    - User needs to select the year in
    the Navigator and time scope for which extract document needs to be created and
    then must click the Create New Data    Extract button.<br>    - To create accrual
    data extract documents, the accrual checkbox must be checked before clicking the
    Create new data extract button.<br>    - The time scope is by default set to <strong>all
    months</strong>. And hence user wants to do any operation for a single month or
    quarter he needs to    change it. Else an error message saying <em>Please select
    a specific month in the time scope</em> will appear.</p><p>    <strong>Buttons
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">VERIFY</span> and <span style="color: rgb(0,
    153, 0);">UN-VERIFY</span> </strong><br>    - If user needs to verify the created
    data extract document for a particular time scope, it needs to be set in the time
    scope dropdown and then verify    button needs to be clicked. The same applies
    if user needs to unverify data extract documents.<br>    - Verified or Approved
    data cannot be edited.<br>    - If an unverified or unapproved Data Extract document
    for the same Data Extract setup and the same period already exists and the user
    tries to create New    Extract - an error will appear in the Logs Tab. Hence,
    if it is verified or approved, the new Data Extract document will use the last
    verified or approved    Data Extract document as its <em>Previous Data Extract</em>.
    This way user can have several revisions of one period and one Data Extract setup.</p><p>    <u>There
    are 3 Tabs in the Data Section in the screen:</u></p><p>    <strong>1. AMOUNT
    Tab</strong><br>    <strong>2. QUANTITY Tab</strong><br>    <strong>3. LOGS Tab.
    </strong></p><p>    Amount and Quantity Tabs have Value, Adjustment and Calculated
    Subtabs.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">VIEW DOCUMENT</span>
    </strong><br>    - In the Value Tab of both Amount and Quantity Tabs of the screen.
    To view data extract document for a month, the user needs to select that month
    in the Time    Scope dropdown and click the VIEW DOCUMENT button.<br>    - A new
    popup should appear which would display the document and different data entries
    and adjustments. There is provision to Verify and Un-verify the    document here.
    Also we can Trace Backward and Forward a document by clicking on the Trace Document
    button in the pop-up screen.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0,
    153, 0);">VIEW PRECEDING DOCUMENT </span></strong><br>    It would display the
    preceding document and different data entries and adjustments. There is provision
    to Verify and Un-verify the document here. Also we    can Trace Backward and Forward
    a document by clicking on the TRACE DOCUMENT button.</p><p>    <strong>Button
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">TRACE DOCUMENT</span></strong><br>    It
    opens a new popup which allows Backward and Forward tracing for a document.</p><p>    <strong>Button
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">TRACE VALUE</span></strong><span style="color:
    rgb(0, 153, 0);"></span><br>    It opens a popup that will display all the values
    that went into producing the single number.</p>'
