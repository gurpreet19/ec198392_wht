  DESCRIPTION: <p>EC codes are basically categorized string constants.</p><p>There are three EC code screens:</p><ul><li>EC Codes-All (BF CO.1011)</li><li>EC Codes - Non-System Codes (BF CD.0034)</li><li>EC Codes - System Codes (BF CD.0084)</li></ul><p>Generally all EC codes are shown in the EC Codes-All screen, whereas the other two screens show only system or non-system EC codes based on the value of the "System Code" attribute. This is split into multiple screens to allow easy access control for end users.</p><p>The <strong>EC Codes - System Codes screen</strong> is used to handle EC codes that are system codes, i.e. IS_SYSTEM_CODE = Y.</p><p>System codes are normally not meant to be modified by customers. They are internal codes used by EC and are already configured as required. Changing them might cause unpredictable behavior. However, there are exceptions, and this screen can be used to modify system codes in these cases.</p><p><br></p>
