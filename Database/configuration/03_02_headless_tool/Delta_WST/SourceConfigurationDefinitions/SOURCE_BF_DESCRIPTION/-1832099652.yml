  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This Business Function is part of the Business Process to gather and QA sub daily well bore interval data, e.g. from a DIACS completion interval (DIACS: Downhole Instrumentation and Control System). It should be used when SCADA systems provide records each 2nd hour / hourly / 30min or at other fixed intervals. This BF supports end user to maintain sub daily production data for specified well bore intervals. The screen lists all sub day data currently available for specified date and well bore interval. If the original data has occasional &ldquo;missing rows&rdquo; (that is, not every half hour when the fixed interval is 30 min), the &ldquo;<em>Generate Missing Rows</em>&rdquo; button will insert any missing rows so that every half hour is accounted for. For these newly inserted rows, an existing period&rsquo;s data will be used as the row&rsquo;s initial value. EC will support copy forward, copy backwards and interpolate methods for generating missing row field values; the customer may select the desired method from a screen popup list. The &ldquo;Aggregate Current&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aggregate Facility All&rdquo;button will aggregate the sub-daily well bore interval information for selected well and well bore. The columns shown on the screen represent the well bore interval data normally associated with one single DIACS completion interval and each DIACS interval installed should therefore be configured as a separate well bore interval.</p>

    <p>The principles for generation of missing data can be summarized as follows. The functionality will try to produce values for all missing data items within the production day will be elements. All attributes (screen columns) are analyzed and generated individually. Only missing or empty data items will be affected. Existing data items will not be modified.</p>

    <p>When &ldquo;Interpolate&rdquo; is selected, any gap in the data will be filled by distributing the difference between the values on either side of the gap evenly over the missing items. If necessary, the search for existing values will be extended to the previous and next production day.</p>

    <p>When &ldquo;Copy Forward&rdquo; is selected, any gap in the data will be filled by copying the most recent value before the gap over all missing items. If necessary, the search for the most recent value will be extended to the previous production day.</p>

    <p>When &ldquo;Copy Backward&rdquo; is selected, any gap in the data will be filled by copying the next value after the gap over all missing items. If necessary, the search for the next value will be extended to the next production day.</p>

    <p>In order to appear in this business function, the well bore interval must have its attribute INTERVAL_TYPE set to &ldquo;DIACS&rdquo;.</p>

    <p>A DIACS (alternatively called SCRAMS&reg; : Surface Controlled Reservoir Analysis and Management System) -schematic and a brief concept description can be found under the related daily business function WR.0035.</p>
