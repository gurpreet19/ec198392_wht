  DESCRIPTION: <p>This Business Function is used to identify the contracts that belong to a given contrcat group. A contract can belong to any number of contrcat groups and a contract&nbsp;group can have any number of contract members. A contract&#39;s group membership is date effective. I.e The association between a given contract and a given&nbsp;contract group has a start and an end date. The end date is optional.</p><p>The contract group is identified using the navigator popup. Contracts can be added and removed using the toolbar Insert and Delete icons. The Delete icon removes&nbsp;the selected contract from the current contract group; it does not delete the contract object itself.</p><p>The Daily, Monthly and Yearly Contract Calculation screens have an optional contract group as as input. If a contract group is identified, the contract calculations will&nbsp;process all contracts that belong to the given group on the given date.</p>
