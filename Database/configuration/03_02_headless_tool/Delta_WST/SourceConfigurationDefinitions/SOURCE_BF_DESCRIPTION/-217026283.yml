  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This business function is used to capture assumptions for both Forecast and Scenario. In addition to capture textual assumptions, it is also possible to upload documents at both levels. The &quot;Forecast&quot; section should be used to document assumptions that apply to the forecast as a whole, while the &quot;Scenario&quot; sections should be used to document assumptions for each individual scenario.</p>

    <p>The supported file upload formats can be configured by using the system property &quot;Forecast Assumptions Allowed File Extensions&quot; in Maintain System Settings (CO.1006). Allowed file extensions need to be listed as comma separated values (eg. .docx,.pdf). Setting the value .* will allow all file extensions to be uploaded. This is also the default value.</p>

    <p> The data sections Forecast Assumptions, Forecast Documents, Scenario Assumptions and Scenario Documents are independent from each other.<p>

    <p> Scenario dropdown is filtered based on Forecast Navigator selection i.e. only related scenario's of selected Forecast will be shown in the drop down.</p>

    <p> This business function requires CATEGORY values Configuration for assumptions on both Forecast and Scenario level. The CATEGORY codes can be configured as:  Go to  'EC Codes - Non-System Codes' -> Select FORECAST_ASSUMPTION_CATEGORY -> EC will be shipped with a set of predefined codes, but as these are non-system codes, the codes can be updated and new ones added as required.<p>
