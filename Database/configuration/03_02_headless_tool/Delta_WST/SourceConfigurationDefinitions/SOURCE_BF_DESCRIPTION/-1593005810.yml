    to insert and maintain Underlift /Overlift Rates and Quantities.</p><p>    <u>-
    Underlift</u>    is a case when you sell less than you have during a month. At
    the end of the month you still have some quantities left. Your status is Underlift.<br>    <u>-
    Overlift</u>    is a case when you sell more than what you have during a month.
    This is possible if you share a storage tank with several others. To fill up an
    oil tanker    you need to "borrow" some quantities from the others.</p><p>    <u>The
    screen is divided into these sections:</u></p><p>    <strong><em>Static Navigator</em></strong><br>    Defines

    of the year this column shows zero.<br>    - UOM for the Opening Quantity.<br>    -
    Opening Pricing Value showing the value of the inventory at the start of the year.
    If the Inventory was in overlift position at the start of the year    this column
    shows zero.<br>    - Currency for the Pricing Value.<br>    - Opening Other Value
    being the Opening Pricing Value converted to the Underlift Other Currency. Set
    to zero if there is no UL Other Currency defined for    the Inventory.<br>    -
    Currency for the Opening Other Value.<br>    - Movement YTD. This number will
    be set to zero if the Inventory was in overlift position at the start of the year.<br>    -
    UOM for the Movement YTD.<br>    - Closing Quantity for the Inventory as a positive
    number when the Inventory is in underlift position. Set to zero if the Inventory
    is in overlift    position.<br>    - UOM for the Closing Quantity.<br>    - Closing
    Pricing Value showing the current value of the inventory. Set to zero if the Inventory
    is in overlift position.<br>    - Currency for the Pricing Value.<br>    - Closing
