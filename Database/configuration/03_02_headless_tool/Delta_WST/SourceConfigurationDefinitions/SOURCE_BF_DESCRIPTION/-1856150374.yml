  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This Business Function is used to enter well bore pressure tests.
    The main purpose for this BF is to calculate the datum pressure based on the pressure
    test.In the above screenshot, we want to calculate pressure in tubing measurement
    (2100), up to communicating reservoir (2000) and down to datum (2500) we have
    to enter Well Bore Name, Daytime , Pressure Type and Observed Pressure and EC
    will calculate the pressure at the depth in second data section.</p><p>Calculation
    Formula :-</p><p><ol><li> When Depth to  is 2000, calculated pressure is  Pressure
    at Depth from +( ( Depth to - Depth from) * Gradient pressure). That means 200
    + (-100*0.175) = 182.5 barg.</li><li> When Depth To is 2500, calculated pressure
    is : 207.6 + (200 * 0.1) = 227.6 barg.</li></ol></p>'
