  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to view nomination data for a location in the system.</p><p>The navigator uses the navigation model to drill down to the target class. The target class is being different objects like DELIVERY_POINT and PIPELINE.</p><p>Typically the nominations are entered on a nomination point and the aggregated to a higher level to get an overview.</p><p>To use this business functions to view nomination for other locations than found in the product, the implementation projects can create a new treeview entry with&nbsp;arguments on the URL. The TARGET argument is used in the navigator, while the CLASS argument is used for the table data sections. It is a requirement that the&nbsp;TARGET can be found in a navigation model, and that the target is the owner of the data in the CLASS. The navigation model can be forced by the project by using&nbsp;NAV_MODEL argument.</p>
