  DESCRIPTION: <p>In order to properly balance their nominations, the shipper will be able to use this business function to verify that each contract is properly balanced. When that is&nbsp;done the shipper can submit the nominations.</p><p>Typical usage of this business function is to allow the shipper to view total requested input and total requested output quantities on contracts. The shipper then&nbsp;needs to press the submit button to run validations that, if passed, will accept the nominations. This screen will also be used to view scheduled and any pipeline&nbsp;imposed adjustments to the nominations.</p><p>The user can view the individual input and output nominations in the lower section of the screen. The shipper can use this view to determine where the imbalance&nbsp;exists.</p><p>The business function is read only. If nominations do not balance, the shipper needs to correct his nominations in the Input Nomination or Output Nomination&nbsp;business functions.</p>
