  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p>The Deferment Summary BF can be used to follow up and track lost volume on a daily basis. This BF is not driven by individual well deferred volumes but rather facility or area volumes and therefore by using this BF&rsquo;s it will not be possible to calculate a well on time from deferment events nor calculate the well theoretical rate from potential minus deferred volumes.</p>

    <p>This BF allows you to follow up deferred volumes every day and make sure that the difference between your planned max capacity and actual production is distributed to open deferment events.</p>

    <p>There will be one important decision to make before using this BF. You need to configure to know the deferment version that you are using. This is configurable by setting the system attribute &quot;DEFERMENT_VERSION&quot;.</p>

    <p>Planned and Actual volumes need to be configured. Planned volumes are taken from Daily Facility Class 1 Forecast(PP.0033) and Actual volumes are taken from the stream which is connected to a dedicated stream set. If you are using DEFERMENT_VERSION which is PD0004 and system attribute &quot;DAILY_DEFERMENT_LEVEL&quot; is set to &rsquo;SUB_ARE&rsquo;, then you must configure user exit package UE_DEFER_SUMMARY.</p>

    <p>The first column of the data section is configurable by changing the code_text for the right code where code_type=&rsquo; DAILY_DEF_SUM_LABEL&rsquo; (EC Codes BF).</p>

    </p>- Deferred volume is the difference of Planned and Actual volumes.<br/>
             - Assigned Deferment is the calculated value of the deferment event added in Deferment (PD.0020) screen. <br/>
            - Unassigned Deferment is the difference of Deferred and Assigned Deferment values.
    </p><p>The &ldquo;Deferment Summary&rdquo; section will display the aggregated Planned, Actual, Deferred, Assigned Deferment and Unassigned Deferment volumes for the selected date and asset (Production Unit or Facility, etc) on the navigator.</p><p>For the &ldquo;Unassigned Deferment Comments&rdquo;, navigator selection will have to be done until Facility for adding or updating of records. Data filtering will not be affected by the navigator selection.</p><p>The &ldquo;Deferment Events&rdquo; section is a collapsible section that will display the deferment events (PD.0020-Deferment) along with the entire event loss for the selected date and asset (Production Unit or Facility, etc). This section will only be visible once the deferment losses has been calculated.</p>
