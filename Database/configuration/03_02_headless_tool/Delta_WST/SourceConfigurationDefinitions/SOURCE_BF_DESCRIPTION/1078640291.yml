  DESCRIPTION: <p>This is the forecast version of CP.0020 - Nomination Split. This business function is used to view or override the default split on Lifting Agreements.</p><p>If the Lifting Account is set up to be connected to a contract and that contract got more than one customer, a default split is created when the nomination is created.</p><p>Nominations for selected cargo in navigator are listed. If the nomination is connected to a Lifting Agreement, the split data section will list all customer companies associated to the Lifting Agreement (Contract). The default split is retrieved from the Contract Parties business function. If no override on the split, the &lsquo;Default Split&rsquo; and the &lsquo;New Split&rsquo; will be the same. The &lsquo;Nomination Qty&rsquo; is calculated based on the nominated quantity on the nomination and the &lsquo;New Split&rsquo; attribute.</p><p>It is possible to insert multiple splits for the same lifter if the lifter needs to deliver same cargo load to multiple port. For this purpose, the class trigger in FCST_STOR_LIFT_CPY_SPLIT needs to be disabled to allow multiple split entry, or project can specify their own logic in ue_Stor_Fcst_Lift_Nom.validateSplitEntry.</p>
