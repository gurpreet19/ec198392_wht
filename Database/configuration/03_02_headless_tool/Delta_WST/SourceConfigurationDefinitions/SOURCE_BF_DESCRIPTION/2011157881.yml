  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Forecast Gas Purchase Revenues screen</strong> is used
    to forecast the revenues for the gas purchase.</p><p>In the navigator the user
    selects which forecast case to view or edit. The selection criteria may include
    a field group. The user may then select among the field groups that have the field
    group type selected when the forecast case was set up.</p><p>In the table below
    the navigator an overview of the quantities for the selected forecast case is
    shown. The numbers in this table are yearly numbers by field with a sum row at
    the bottom. If a field group was selected in the navigator, this table will only
    include the fields that are members of that group.</p><p>Then a month-by-month
    table showing monthly numbers by field is displayed. This table also includes
    an adjustment line. The content of this line is the difference between last year''s
    December accrual numbers and the actual December numbers. All quantity data entry
    will be done through this table.</p><p>At the very bottom of the screen is a section
    where the user can enter comments. Any number of comments can be inserted by normal
    insert functionality, not necessarily four rows as in the example screenshot above.
    The comments will be by forecast case, product and field.</p><p>All parts of the
    forecast case will be populated when the Populate Forecast Case on the Properties
    screen is pressed. The quantity part of this logic will work as follows:</p><ul><li>The
    numbers in the Plan Qty column will be copied from the referenced quantity forecast
    case that is selected on the Properties panel by using the selected stream items
    for the forecast object.</li><li>If the Populate Method is PLAN, then all columns
    except the Plan Qty column will initially be empty. The user will then have to
    enter Commercial Adjustment, Swap Adjustment and Sales Qty. Available Sale will
    be Plan Qty less the two adjustments. Inventory Movement will be Available Sale
    less Sales Qty.</li><li>In the month-by-month table the rows will get status PLAN
    if the Populate Method is PLAN or if the month in question is later than the Forecast
    Case month. In the screenshot above, the forecast case''s month is May, and therefore
    the June thru December months are editable.</li><li>For the months after the month
    of the Forecast Case, the adjustment quantities and the sales quantity will be
    copied from the official forecast case for the previous month. The user may change
    them if necessary. The plan quantity will be copied from the connected quantity
    forecast case. This will trigger a recalculation of available sales quantity and
    inventory movement.</li><li>For the months up to and including the month of the
    Forecast Case object, actual numbers will be copied into forecast case. The Plan
    Qty will be actual numbers copied from the selected stream items. The Commercial
    Adjustment will sum all as-is quantities from the quantities module for the selected
    stream item category for the month and field in question. The Swap Adjustment
    quantity will be calculated the same way using the selected stream item category
    for Swap Adjustments. Available Sale will then be Plan Qty less Commercial Adjustment
    and Swap Adjustment. The Sales Qty will be sum of all quantities sold from the
    field in the month in question. This lookup is done by finding the line items
    selling from the field in question that belong to transactions with point of sale
    date within the month in question. The documents that these transactions belong
    to must be set to BOOKED. Finally, Inventory Movement will be the difference between
    Available Sale and Sales Qty. The status will be ACCRUAL if any of the actual
    numbers are ACCRUAL. All actual numbers must have status FINAL for the record
    to get status FINAL.</li><li>An exception to this will be made to the Sales Qty
    for the month after the forecast case''s month, i.e. June in the example screenshot
    above. There will be a lifting plan for the cargos in this month, and therefore
    this number will be fetched from the actual tables and not from the official forecast
    case for the previous month. The number will however still be editable for the
    user to change if necessary.</li><li>On the Prior Year Adjustment line the user
    has to enter any adjustments and the Sales Qty. The Available Sale and the Inventory
    Movement will then be calculated. For liquids shipped by cargos, there will normally
    not be any adjustments to the sales quantity. This means that any adjustment to
    the available sales quantity will only influence the inventory movement. The sales
    quantity cell will nonetheless be editable for the user to enter any number.</li></ul><p>The
    same rules apply for both PLAN and YEAR TO MONTH population.</p><ul><li>Purchase
    Quantity: populated automatically from Quantities screen</li><li>Cost Price: populated
    automatically from Prices screen</li><li>Sales Price: populated automatically
    from Prices screen</li><li>Forex: populated automatically from Prices screen</li><li>Local
    Cost Price: populated automatically from Prices screen</li><li>Local Sales Price:
    populated automatically from Prices screen</li><li>Purchase Cost: Purchase Cost
    = Purchase Quantity * Cost Price * Forex</li><li>Sales Revenue: Sales Revenue
    = Purchase Quantity * Local Sales Price</li><li>Net Revenue: Net Revenue = Purchase
    Cost + Sales Revenue.</li></ul>'
