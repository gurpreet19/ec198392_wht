  DESCRIPTION: '<p>A status process is a job that can be run to update records status
    on a set of data classes.</p><p>Record status controls data access to the data.
    There are three record statuses configured in EC.</p><dir><li><p>P = Provisional.
    Data inserted manually will become provisional. This is the lowest security level.</p>
    </li><li><p> V = Verified. Provisional data can be lifted to verified by running
    a process</p></li><li><p> A = Approved. This is the highest security level. A
    monthly process will set data to approved.</p></li></dir><p>It is recommended
    to create one process for provisional to verify process for each facility and
    one process for verify to approve process for each monthly reconciliation network
    (for all facilities producing into a terminal &ndash; integrated system).</p><p>Data
    status can be updated from P to V and to A, and also in the reverse direction.
    The revision tracking will track the record status being updated in both directions.
    Status process will not be triggered if the date affects a Globally or Locally
    locked month.</p><p>One status process can be a child of another process and it
    can also have its own process tasks. A process task is a configuration of one
    task to update record status for one single data class. An extra where clause
    can be added to make sure that only records belonging to one particular facility
    is updated. To find out how to write the where clause, see attribute description
    below.</p><p>Note: Due to differences in types and requirements of classes, some
    classes have special handling in this business function. More details are included
    in the mentioned attribute descriptions.</p><p>The screen consists of 3 sections;
    the attributes for each section are further described below.'
