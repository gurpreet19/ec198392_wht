  DESCRIPTION: <p>The PKI Verification solution is for documenting that data in EC is correct with the signed data. It’s a place where the user can search through all documents that have been signed with a signing service. The documents in the verification table consist of the same documents the user viewed and confirmed in the signing process.</p><p>The «Verify»–button will take the selected row and compare this data with the data document that is stored with the signing service. The table will then be updated with information about the verification. If it returns a verification failure, it means that the data has changed since the signing was performed. The screen will also give a view of the data document that is verified from the signing service.</p>
