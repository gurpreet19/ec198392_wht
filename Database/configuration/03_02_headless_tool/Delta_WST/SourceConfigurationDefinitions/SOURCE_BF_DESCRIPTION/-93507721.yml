  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Data Entry Interface screen</strong>    is used to
    view and approve Data Entries being interfaced from a financial system.</p><h3>    <strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Navigator</strong></h3><p>    The navigator lets
    the user set these values as search criteria for the Source Documents section:<br>    <strong><em>-
    Uploaded Date-From:</em></strong>    Uploads executed after this date will be
    listed,<br>    <strong><em>- Uploaded Date-To:</em></strong>    Uploads executed
    before this date will be listed,<br>    <strong><em>- Business Unit:</em></strong>    Uploads
    having the selected Business Unit will be listed,<br>    <strong><em>- Document:</em></strong>    Uploads
    having the selected Document Name will be listed,<br>    <strong><em>- Status:</em></strong>    Uploads
    having the selected Status will be listed.</p><h3>    <strong style="color: rgb(0,
    0, 153);">Source Documents</strong></h3><p>    The Source Documents section of
    the screen contains a table that lists all the Source Documents that fit the search
    criteria given by the navigator values.<br>    <u>The table has these columns:
    </u><br>    <strong><em>- Name:</em></strong>    The name of the upload - typically
    coming from the uploaded source data,<br>    <strong><em>- Period:</em></strong>    The
    financial period the upload refers to,<br>    <strong><em>- Status:</em></strong>    The
    status of the upload,<br>    <strong><em>- Data Entry Count:</em></strong>    The
    number of Data Entries in the upload,<br>    <strong><em>- Upload Date:</em></strong>    The
    date of the upload into EC,<br>    <strong><em>- Version:</em></strong>    The
    version of the upload. When the same source is uploaded again for the same financial
    period the Version number will automatically increase.</p><p>    The section has
    the following buttons:</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0, 153,
    0);">Approve Document</span></strong><br>    For a Source Document to be available
    to the subsequent process steps in EC it must be set to Approved. This button
    will approve the selected source    document.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color:
    rgb(0, 153, 0);">Un-Approve Document</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0,
    153, 0);"></span><br>    A document that has been approved can be set to un-approved
    by this button. Note that if the source document has already been used as an input
    document in    the subsequent process it can''t be un-approved. Also, if there
    is a new version of the upload for the same period it is not allowed to un-approve.</p><p>    <strong>Button
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Trace Document</span></strong><br>    The
    Trace Document button will open a popup window showing the Tracing information
    for the selected source document. In most of the cases a Data Entry    Interface
    document will be the ''first'' entity in a chain of process steps. Because of
    this there will normally be no ''Trace Backwards'' for these documents.    The
    ''Trace Forwards'' tab in the Document Tracing screen will typically show the
    document that has been created based on the selected Data Entry document.</p><h3>    <strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">The Second Navigator</strong></h3><p>    The second
    navigator is to view all the interfaced entries for current source document. By
    default, the entries does not retrieve to the screen. This to    speed up the
    Source Document section. The entries can be filtered by these search criteria:<br>    <strong><em>-
    Layout:</em></strong>    To filter on a specific dataset. Will also set the table
    layout accordingly.<br>    <strong><em>- Account:</em></strong>    To filter on
    a specific account. A value can be selected or a new value can be entered directly
    into the drop-down list.<br>    <strong><em>- WBS</em></strong>    : To filter
    on a specific WBS. A value can be selected or a new value can be entered directly
    into the drop-down list.<br>    <strong><em>- Cost Center:</em></strong>    To
    filter on a specific cost center. A value can be selected or a new value can be
    entered directly into the drop-down list.<br>    <strong><em>- Revenue Order:</em></strong>    To
    filter on a specific revenue order. A value can be selected or anew value can
    be entered directly into the drop-down list.<br>    <strong><em>- Project:</em></strong>    To
    filter on a specific project. A value can be selected or a new value can be entered
    directly into the drop-down list.<br>    <strong><em>- Dataset:</em></strong>    To
    filter on a specific dataset.</p><h3>    <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Entries

    arrow).</p><p>    <u>Note </u>    that you are not obliged to set any filters
    in the second navigator - but if the Source Document contains a large number of
    records it is recommended to    set a filter before retrieving the data.</p><h3>    <strong

    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Additional Information</strong></h3><p>    Journal
    Entries from Financial Systems can be imported to EC through class view TV_IFAC_JOURNAL_ENTRY.
    The interfacing can be done by inserting records to    TV_IFAC_JOURNAL_ENTRY directly,
    using Data Uploader, or by ECIS.</p><p>    It is possible to keep data entry source
    information by setting the SOURCE_DOC_NAME column in the interfaced records. Data
    entries from the same source    document can be interfaced multiple times for
    a specific period, and EC keeps track of each upload by assigning source document
    version. Data entries with    an old version is considered being replaced by new
    version in the same period. The Data Mapping process picks up only Data Entries
    with latest source    document version.</p><p>    Note that source document version
    won''t be assigned automatically as the system receives Data Entries one by one
    rather than as a whole upload at a time.    To trigger the system to assign source
    document versions, two methods can be used:</p><p>    - By calling procedure ECDP_RR_REVN_MAPPING_INTERFACE.
    Approve All Latest Upload<br>    - By clicking the button "Approve" on this Business
    Function</p><p>    To un-approve an uploaded document, select the document and
    click Un-Approve button. Please note that it is not possible to un-approve a document
    where    there is new upload on the same document.</p><p>    Source Document Name
    is mandatory for Data Entry.</p>'
