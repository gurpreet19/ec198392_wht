  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Forecast Revenue Setup screen</strong> is used to define<span
    style="color: rgb(64, 103, 165);"> </span>Products and Stream Items taking part
    in each Revenue Forecast Case.</p><p>A forecast object is the combination of the
    forecast case described in the previous section and the different products and
    the different fields or contracts depending on the forecast approach. This information
    is copied from the source to the copy when the copy forecast button is pressed.</p><p>The
    user has to create combinations of products and UOMs for the forecast object.
    If Commercial Adjustment or Swap Adjustments should be included in the forecast
    case, stream item categories for this must be selected. If Value Adjustment or
    Percent Adjustment applies to the forecast case the user must also select a fixed
    value line item type or Y/N, respectively. Any number of such combinations can
    be created. The user must also select a currency in which the prices are entered.
    This currency may be different for the different forecast objects. Optionally,
    the user can select a general price from which the prices are fetched when the
    forecast case is generated. This will be described in detail later.</p><p>For
    Liquids and Gas Sales the user must then select from which stream items to get
    the quantity data for the different field. This selection is done forecast object
    by forecast object. The field list is automatically given from the referenced
    quantity forecast case. The system will when the quantity forecast object is saved
    try to find which stream items to fetch the quantities from. This is done by looking
    for one distinct stream item that has references to the same stream item category
    and field as the one in the quantity forecast case, but that references the product
    from the revenue forecast object and the company from the forecast case. These
    two are not necessarily the same as the ones in the quantity forecast case. If
    the system finds more than one such stream item, it will be left to the user to
    select which one to use by selecting from the popup the correct one among the
    candidates satisfying the four selection criteria. In the Gas Sales example screenshot
    above the system did not find any quantity stream item for Field 7 ad Field 12
    and no adjustment stream items for Field 3 and Field 7.</p><p>In addition for
    Liquids and Gas Sales the user might relate one field setup with one or more inventory
    cases. In that case, the booked numbers found on the inventory will be used during
    the population of the forecast case for the attributes Opening Position, Closing
    Position, Rate and Closing Value.</p><p>For Gas Purchases the user must select
    which purchase contracts to include in the forecast case. This is done by using
    normal insert procedures combined with a popup. This popup will be filtered to
    include only purchase contracts that are connected to the forecast object product.</p><p>For
    Gas Purchases when adding contracts to a product, the contract popup should only
    show contracts where the Company Owner = Company in the properties screen.</p>'
