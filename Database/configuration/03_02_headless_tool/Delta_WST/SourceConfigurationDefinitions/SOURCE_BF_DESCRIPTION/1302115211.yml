  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>

    <p>This BF is used to  create Regulatory Permits received from the authorities. These permits are important to log and assositate with events in the system.</p>

    <p>Other objects (e.g. wells, streams, equipment) and environmental events will need to create a relationship to the Regulatory Permits. For example, in the Maintain Well screen, an attribute might be added to allow the user to select a regulatory permit from a drop down list. Another example, when inputting an environmental event, the user will click a drop down list to see regulatory permits and may select one to associate with the environmental event.</p>
