  DESCRIPTION: <p>This Business Function (BF) incorporates dips(Gauges) and export events(Run Tickets/Dispositions) for tanks.</p><p>First data section filters tanks based on navigation selection and user will then be directed to one of the 3 tabs based on selected record type (Gauged/Run Tickets/Dispositions) on that row.</p><p>The 3 corresponding tabs provides inserting/updating/deleting functionalities as below:-</p><p>1. Gauged</p><p>This tab duplicates PO.0082-Event Tank Status-VCF Calc which is used when there is no calculated closing volume available for the tank and recordings are for many tank readings per day.</p><p>Input to this business function is strapping heights for both liquid level and water level. The observed temperature and gravity is used to call the API program to determine correct gravity and volume correction factor (VCF).</p><p>The VCF, bs&amp;w and strapping tables are used to calculate closing net oil and water for the day. Recording in this BF is for information only and the official closing end of production day reading must be recorded in one of the daily tank screen and not here.</p><p>2. Run Tickets</p><p>This tab has three data sections. The first and second data sections are used to enter data for a batch export from a tank when there is no outgoing meter measuring the export.There can be many exports per</p><p>day per tank. The exported volume belongs to only one production day. API calculations will be used to calculate Net volume. Ticket volume is the official volume</p><p>and is by default set to net volume, but can be manually updated. The result of the double dip is stored on an outgoing stream. There must always be one outgoing stream per tank for this BF. The connection between tank and</p><p>stream is configured when you create a new tank. The attribute "Export Stream" is used. These both data sections are duplicates of PO.0023-Batch Oil Tank Export.</p><p>Third data section is used capture seal data on tank. It is used when a seal is replaced for the purpose of maintenance and not during transport of the tank liquid.</p><p>Seal is mainly used for security purpose. The records are valid for the period. The period can be of any length of either by "hourly" or "daily".</p><p>. This section duplicates PO.0089 - Event Tank Seal</p><p>3. Dispositions</p><p>The first data section duplicates PO.0100-Truck Ticket single Transfer Object which is used to register trucked oil volumes transported to/from/between facility objects in the EC production.</p><p>The second data section is a copy of PO.0089 - Event Tank Seal which is used to capture seal data on a tank which is also explained above.</p>
