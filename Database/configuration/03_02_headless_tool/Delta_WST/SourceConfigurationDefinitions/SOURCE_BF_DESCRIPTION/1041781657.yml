  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Calendar Collection Screen</strong> is used for grouping
    several Calendars into a group.</p><p>EC has functionality for automatically determining
    actual dates for Document Date, Document Received Date, and Payment Date for the
    Financial Documents. In case the determination of these dates involves Business
    Days vs Holidays then EC requires that there is a Calendar for defining each date
    of the year whether the day in question is a Business Day or a Holiday.</p><p>The
    Calendar Collection objects are connected to a contract instead of the Calendar.
    When using the Calendar Collection together with Payment Due Date calculation,
    Document Date calculation and Document Received Date etc. it will be the combination
    of Business Days / Holidays of the calendars in the collection that will determine
    the Business Days / Holidays.</p><p><br></p><p>The screen is organized with these
    key components:</p><p>- Navigator&nbsp;</p><p>- List of Calendar Collection objects&nbsp;</p><p>-
    Tabs for Calendar Collection Object / Calendar Collection Members / Calendar Collection
