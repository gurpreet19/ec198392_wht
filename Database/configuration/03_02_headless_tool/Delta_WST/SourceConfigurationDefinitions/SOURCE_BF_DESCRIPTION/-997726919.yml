The project must add this functionality (project-specific buttons).<br />The project should keep the &ldquo;Upstream&rdquo; and &ldquo;Downstream&rdquo; columns of the first table editable. This will make it possible to enter the daily quantities to split.</p><p>The navigation model uses by default TRAN_COMMERCIAL, but a different navigational model can be used by sending the navigational model as an argument from&nbsp;the treeview (argument NAV_MODEL). When using a different navigational model it is important to be aware of the owner of the data class and the target must be&nbsp;the same object.</p><p>To see arguments made available for this business function please see section 1.2.4.2.</p><p>Mandatory arguments which are needed in the url are only CLASS and SUB_CLASS.</p>
