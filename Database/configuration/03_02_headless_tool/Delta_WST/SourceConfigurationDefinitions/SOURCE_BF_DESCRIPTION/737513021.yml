  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to view the total quantity of gas that are nominated and scheduled to flow on delivery point daily and sub daily.</p><p>All quantities shown in this screen have already been grossed up for fuel as applicable for each of the underlying contract nominations. Operational nominations are&nbsp;also included when present. The business function can be used both before and within the gasday for which the gas is planned to flow.</p><p>A typical use case scenario for this business function is for the transportation service provider&rsquo;s gas control operations staff to view the current delivery point target&nbsp;after the nominated quantities have been confirmed by the downstream/upstream delivery point operators. The gas control operator using this business function will&nbsp;then be able to verify the currently proposed schedule against their physical flow models. If the gas schedule can be physically flown, the gas contol operator can&nbsp;approve the schedule by generating the gas control report.</p>
