The objects where an implementation needs capacity, the object must implement the&nbsp;OPERATIONAL_RESTRICTION interface.</p><p>Capacity restrictions can happen, either due to planned or unplanned events. This information is needed by the scheduling process for balancing the contracts&nbsp;against the allowable physical limitations of the pipeline.</p><p>By selecting an object in the navigator the restriction for selected date will be listed. A new restriction can be entered by pressing the insert button.</p><p>Note that restriction can be calculated based on other restrictions and the output from capacity calculation can be viewed here</p>
