  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to maintain document instruction templates for a lifting account.</p><p>The template and its receivers are created in Lifting Account Document Receiver Template (CO.2031). If Cargo Document Template is set in Lifting Account &nbsp;Document Receiver Template, the list of documents is configured in Cargo Document Template (CO.2033). If Cargo Document Template is not set the default list in&nbsp;the EC Code CARGO_DOCUMENT is used.</p><p>This template can be used (and overridden) in Document Receiver and Document Instruction in cargo planning.</p><p>The Instructions data section can be viewed either with Receivers as rows, or with Documents as rows. The second, optional view may be preferred if there is a&nbsp;significantly large number of documents per receiver. Please refer to the Business Functions URL section for details on how to activate this functionality.</p>
