  DESCRIPTION: "<p>This business function is used to display the analysis for a comparison\
    \ object selected on the navigator. <br/>\n    Comparison object is defined in\
    \ Forecast Define Scenarios to Compare(PP.0056). Each comparison is linked to\
    \ the last selected asset from the navigator (Production Unit, Facility, etc.)).\
    \ For eg: if Comparison 01 is created when the navigator is selected up to Production\
    \ Unit, it will only be filtered when the navigator is until Production Unit.</p>\n\
    \    <p>The business function consists of five tabs as follows:</p>\n    <ol><li>\
    \ Scenario Analysis</li> <li> Details Per Variable</li><li> Details Per Phase</li><li>\
    \ Events Per Category</li><li> Event Details </li></ol><br/>\n    <h><b>1. <u>SCENARIO\
    \ ANALYSIS</u></b></h><p>This business function is used to display the calculated\
    \ analysis for a comparison defined in PP.0056:Forecast Define Scenarios to Compare.</p>\n\
    \    <p>Currently, the screen has a tab - SCENARIO ANALYSIS and it is divided\
    \ into the following data sections:</p>\n    <p><b>Analysis Result</b></p>\n \
    \   <p>This data section will filter analysis result for each component and phase\
    \ based on the selected Analysis Type and Comparison.</p>\n    <p> There is a\
    \ dependency between the analysis and the components filtered and the calculation\
    \ should check the dependency prior to inserting the results in FCST_SCENARIO_ANALYSIS\
    \ table.</P>\n    <p>The analysis type is maintained as EC Codes (CO.1011) and\
    \ the code type is &quot;FCST_SCENARIO_ANALYSIS_TYPE&quot;</p>\n    <p>The components\
    \  are defined as EC Codes (CO.1011). To configure the list of codes, go to EC\
    \ Codes - All Screen -> Select Code Type=&quot;FCST_COMPONENT_ANALYSIS&quot; ->\
    \ Configure Code as required. Please remember to build the dependency between\
    \ these two EC Codes.</p>\n    <p> The available phases are Oil, Gas, Water, Condensate,\
    \ Gas Lift, Diluent, Gas Injection, Water Injection, Steam Injection and CO2 Injection.</p>\n\
    \    <p> The UPDATE ANALYSIS button calls ecdp_forecast_prod.calculateanalysis\
    \ procedure to recalculate the analysis results.</p>\n    <p><b> Analysis Comments\
    \ </b> </p>\n    <p> This data section is used to add comments for the selected\
    \ analysis type.</p>\n    <p><b> Analysis Documents </b> </p>\n    <p> This data\
    \ section is used to attach and view the documents the selected analysis type.</p>\n\
    \t<p>The supported file upload formats can be configured by using the system property\
    \ &quot;Forecast Scenarios Analysis Allowed File Extensions&quot; in Maintain\
    \ System Settings (CO.1006). Allowed file extensions need to be listed as comma\
    \ separated values (eg. .docx,.pdf). Setting the value .* will allow all file\
    \ extensions to be uploaded. This is also the default value.</p>\n\t<BR/><h><b>2.\
