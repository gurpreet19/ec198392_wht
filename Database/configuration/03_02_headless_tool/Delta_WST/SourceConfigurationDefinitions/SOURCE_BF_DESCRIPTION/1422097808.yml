  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">        Transactional Inventory
    module in EC Revenue allows complex        inventory valuations using the EC calculation
    engine. It is a standard        calculation where minimal calculation knowledge
    is required and can be        fully configured through creating EC objects and
    configuration. It has        been designed with the intention of creating templates
    with standard        functionality. And for the cases that do not conform to the
    normal        rules, overrides can be created to cater for the exceptions.    </em></p><p>    <strong>Transactional
    Inventory Properties screen</strong>    is used to manage Transactional Inventory
    objects.</p><p>    The versioned attributes tell EC Revenue how to look up the
    objects, rates    or codes, laying methods etc. It needs to perform monthly TI
    Calculations.</p><p>    The Transactional Inventory Setup screen (BF IN.0036)
    allows connecting    Inventories to Product Streams for running the Transactional
    Inventory    Calculation.</p>'
