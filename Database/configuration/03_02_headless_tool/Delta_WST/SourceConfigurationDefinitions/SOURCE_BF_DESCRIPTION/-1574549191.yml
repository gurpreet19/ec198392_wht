  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to enter data from a chart recorder (typical 7-days Barton charts) measuring gas stream data. The data and configuration is then used as input parameters to the AGA3/8 library for volume calculation. Three methods are supported:</p>

    <p>AGA3/8 &ndash; GRS1 (Gross characterization method 1. Input: volumetric gross heating value, relative density, mole fraction CO2)</p>

    <p>AGA3/8 &ndash; GRS2 (Gross characterization method 2. Input: Relative density, mole fraction CO2 and mole fraction N2)</p>

    <p>AGA3 &ndash; (uses only AGA3 library and constants for compressibility factors)</p>

    <p>The output from these calculations is a volume for the period. This volume is valid for the period. The period can be of any length, but must be within a month. If a chart recorder is recording over a month end, the result must be split into two registrations, one for the first month and one for the second.</p>

    <p>The save button saves any edited value to the database and calculates Specific Gravity, Static Pressure and Differential Pressure. The volume is being calculated</p>

    <p>when clicking the button &ldquo;Calculate Volume&rdquo;. The configuration used for the volume calculation is being validated when clicking this button. If any of the configuration data is not being accepted by the calculation, a dialog box will appear to inform the user about the not-passed validation. In such a case, the calculation is aborted.</p>
