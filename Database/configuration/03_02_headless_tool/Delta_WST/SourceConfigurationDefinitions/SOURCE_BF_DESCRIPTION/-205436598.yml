  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic maintain screen, see description of generic maintain screen in the beginning of the configuration manual</p>

    <p>This screen is used to maintain reference value for a well. A well can specify its own reference value or use other well&rsquo;s reference value. To use other&rsquo;s values, the well has to be configured to refer to a well through the maintain Well screen. Well Reference Object is the attribute that will point to which well to use. The priority will be given to the well&rsquo;s own values.</p>

    <p>The functionality can best be described using the following diagram:</p>

    <p>Well A will show its own reference value because it does have its own.</p>

    <p>Well B will show values that come from Well C because it is referring to Well C as its Well Reference Object</p>
