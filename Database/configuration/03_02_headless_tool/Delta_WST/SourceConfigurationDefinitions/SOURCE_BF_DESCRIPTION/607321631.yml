  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to maintain renomination when using the cycle approach is not adequate.</p><p>The benefit of using this business for doing renominations instead of the Nomination Cycle approach, is that all the previously stored daily nominations will be listed&nbsp;in table showing related renominations. The system supports to automatically copy the value of the re-nomination qty columns to the corresponding daily nomination.&nbsp;Anyhow it will be up to the implementation project to include any required validation and handling of the renominations.</p><p>For more information about the nomination process pls. See Daily Input Nomination / Daily Input Nomination.</p>
