  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Stream Item screen</strong>    is used to maintain
    Stream Item objects.</p><p>    <strong>Stream Item object</strong>    is the data
    entity holding the quantities in the Quantity module. It is    also used in the
    Financial Transaction module where the Stream Item is also    used for defining
    which Fields objects to allocate the monetary values to    for the posting to
    the financial system.</p><p>    <u>        Each Stream Item has a Calculation
    Method attribute set which tells how        to calculate the Stream Item:    </u><br>    <strong>IP:</strong>    Input<br>    <strong>SK:</strong>    Calculated
    by a Split Key<br>    - The Formula attribute tells which Stream Item will be
    the basis for the    calculation<br>    - A reference to a Split Key object to
    use as basis for the calculation<br>    - A reference to which object in the Split
    Key to use for the calculation:<br> <em>    Which Company to pick for a Company
    Split Key,<br>    Which Field to pick for a Field Split Key,<br>    Which Product
    to pick for a Product Split Key,<br>    Which Stream Item to pick for a Stream
    Item Split Key,<br>    Which Other object to pick for an Other Split Key. </em><br>    <strong>FO:</strong>    Calculated
    by a Formula consisting of other Stream Items. The formula uses    normal operators
    such as +, -, *, / , constants and brackets. A formula can    have no more than
    2000 characters. Please note that you can either enter    the formula directly
    in the Formula edit field or use the Formula builder    through the popup associated
    with the Formula edit field.<br>    <strong>CO: </strong>    Defined as a constant
    value that can have the same value from day to day    and month to month. The
    instantiation process will copy the value from the    previous day / month for
    these Stream Items.</p><p>    <u> Stream Item is uniquely identified by its object
    ID and Code as for any    other object in EC. In addition a Stream Item has four
    attributes set which    are used in filtering in popups. <br> These attributes
    are:</u><br>    <strong>Stream Item category:</strong>    a stream item category
    defined for the stream category of the stream. The    Stream Item Categories are
    separate objects.<br>    <strong>Product</strong>    given by the product defined
    at the Stream Item<br>    <strong>Field</strong>    which Field the quantity belongs
    to:<br>    - A specific Field object when the quantity is for a given Field<br>    -
    The SUM field when the quantity is for multiple fields.<br>    <strong>Company</strong>    which
    Company the quantity belongs to:<br>    - A specific Company object when the quantity
    is for a given Company<br>    - The FULL Company when the quantity is for multiple
    companies.</p><p>    <u> Each Stream Item object has attributes for controlling
    the instantiation    and behavior of the Stream Item: </u><br>    <strong>Measurement
    Node:</strong>    Tells whether the quantity is measured at the From Node or the
    To Node of    the Stream associated with the Stream Item.<br>    <strong>Master
    UOM Group:</strong>    Defines whether it is the Volume, Energy, or Mass quantity
    that is the    master quantity. When changing the master quantity the other quantities
    are    recalculated using conversion factors.<br>    <strong>Daily Accrual Method:</strong>    Defines
    a method for creating an Accrual daily quantity for the Stream Item    in the
    Quantity module.<br>    - <u>Last available daily actual:</u> Copies the value
    form the latest day    prior to the day in question<br>    <u>- Months average
    daily actual:</u>    Calculates an average number based on the existing daily
    numbers for the    month in question<br>    <u>- Manual entry:</u>    User will
    manually enter the accrual values<br>    <strong>Monthly Accrual Method:</strong>    Defines
    a method for creating an Accrual monthly quantity for the Stream    Item in the
    Quantity module.<br>    - Previous months available value: Copies the value for
    the month prior to    the month in question<br>    - Average daily number in month
    and multiply with number of days in month:    Calculates an average of the daily
    quantities and multiplies with the    number of days of the month in question<br>    -
    Manual entry: User will manually enter the accrual values<br>    <strong>Reporting
    Category</strong>    defines whether the quantity is Unique or a Duplicate. Useful
    for reporting    purposes where one can omit duplicate quantities to avoid double-counting    the
    quantities.<br>    <strong>Conversion Method:</strong><br>    <u>- Calculated:</u>    No
    conversion is taking place when changing the quantities for the various    UOMs
    such as Volume, Energy, or Mass<br>    <u>- Conversion Factor:</u>    The conversion
    factors are used to calculate the other quantities when    changing one quantity.<br>    <strong>Enable
    Volume/Mass/Energy/Extra1/Extra2/Extra3:</strong>    defines which of these quantity
    elements that are going to be enabled or    not in the screens in the Quantity
    module.<br>    <strong>Default UOM for Volume/Mass/Energy/Extra1/Extra2/Extra3:</strong>    defines
    the UOM to set for the instantiated Stream Items. Please note that    if the Stream
    Item has been instantiated for the preceding day or month    then the UOM of the
    Stream Item for that day / month is used instead.<br>    <strong>Set to Zero instantiation
    Method    Daily: </strong><br>    <u>NULL:</u>    The Stream Item gets a NULL
    value for the quantities when instantiated<br>    <u>Set to Zero and Accrual:</u>    The
    Stream Item will be set to zero (0) and Accrual when instantiated.<br>    <u>Set
    to Zero and Final:</u>    The Stream Item will be set to zero (0) and Final when
    instantiated.</p><p>    <u> Please note </u> that when changing the core attributes
    of a Stream Item object    the system can run a scheduler job in the background
    to find all the    instantiated Stream Items affected by the change and then calculate
    new    quantity values for these Stream Items. For more details on this feature,    please
    see BF VO.0031 - Daily SI Pending Calculation screen.</p><p>    <u> Changing one
    or more of these attributes will kick off this job:</u><br>    - Calculation Method,<br>    -
    Formula,<br>    - Split Key object,<br>    - Split Key basis (defined in the Formula
    field),<br>    - Split Key object (Company/Product/Field/Stream Item/Other),<br>    -
    Conversion Method.</p>'
