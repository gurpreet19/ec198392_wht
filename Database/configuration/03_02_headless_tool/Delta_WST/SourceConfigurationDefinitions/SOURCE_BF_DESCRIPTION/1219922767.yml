  DESCRIPTION: '<p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">This
    Business Function is part of the Business Process to enter component analysis
    results for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) streams.</span></p><p style="font-family:
    Arial, Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">A new analysis will be created
    when clicking on the insert button in the toolbar and saving the record after
    the mandatory values have been specified. When saving the analysis, the belonging
    component set is automatically created. The component set being used is a pre-configured
    set of hydrocarbon components, which is specified in the configuration screen
    for the hydrocarbon component set. The records can be filtered by providing the
    navigator values for Group Model, Analysis Status and Sampling Method. Group Model
    navigator values are mandatory while navigator values for Analysis Status and
    Sampling Method are optional. Analysis data will be filtered based on Valid From
    date. If this value is null, data will be filtered according to the production
    day of the analysis Daytime.</span></p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;"><span
    style="font-size: small;">The ''Mol to Wt'' button will calculate weight percent
    for each component when all mol percent of components are not null. On the other
    hand, the ''Wt to Mol'' button will calculate mol percent for each component when
    all weight percent of components are not null. When pressing these buttons, this
    calculation will be conducted on Db level, meaning it uses the values that are
    stored in the database. The calculation factors (mol wt) that are being used are
    fetched from a database table containing time-dependent constants on each of the
    hydrocarbon components. A configuration interface for the conversion factors exists
    as a part of the configuration screens (Component Constant screen). However, the
    conversion factor for the heaviest component is always the Cn+ constant from the
    analysis. This implies that the component set must <em>always </em>contain a heavy
    component (e.g. C5+) where this component <em>must not </em>have a mol wt specified.</span></p><p
    style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">The ''Normalize''
    button will scale all component numbers with the same factor </span></p><p><em>
    x = 100% / &sum;<sub>&forall;component</sub> component_percentage </em></p><p
    style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">For both
    weight and mol percentages to have the sum add up to 100%.</span></p><p style="font-family:
    Arial, sans-serif; margin: 10px 0px 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size:
    small;">If the stream is assigned a specific constant standard, &nbsp;The constant
    standard will be picked up in the following order:</span></p><div style="margin:
    10px 0px 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">1)
    Ref. Oil Const Std (It will be checked first for any std specified in stream)<br>2)
    Ref. Gas Const Std (If&nbsp;<span class="error">[1]</span>&nbsp;is empty, constant
    standard will be picked from this)<br><br></span></div><div style="margin: 10px
    0px 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If
    both of the above Constant Standards are empty or a stream is not assigned to
    a specified constant standard, ISO6976 which is a default standard (configured
    in System Attribute screen(CO.1012)) will be used in the calculation.</span></div><p
    style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">It is very
    important for users to ensure that components and mol wt are specified for the
    constant standard (in the Component Constant screen(CO.010)) including for ISO6976.
    Conversion calculation will only work if components and mol wt are defined.</span></p><p
    style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">The Copy
    Analysis button is used to create a new analysis using an existing analysis. To
    copy an analysis, select the analysis to copy from and then enter the date selected
    in the &ldquo;New Date&rdquo; dropdown and hit the &ldquo;Copy Analysis&rdquo;
    button.  The new analysis record will have Analysis Status as &ldquo;New&rdquo;
    and Component set will also be copied. The Valid From date can be updated as per
    user requirement.</span></p>'
