  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to enter component quality values for a contract on period bases.</p><p>There exist two data section in this screen, the first one is for storing the contract with a start date. The second data section is where the contract components are to&nbsp;be stored with a value. The configuration for the component section is based on Component Set (CO.0087) and Component Set List (CO.0088).&nbsp;A predefined list of components to be used for this BF is called TR_QUALITY_COMP. The components which are defined in this configuration screen will be made&nbsp;available in the second data section for this business function (Quality Handling).</p><p>The navigation model uses by default TRAN_COMMERCIAL, but a different navigational model can be used by sending the navigational model as an argument from&nbsp;the treeview (argument NAV_MODEL). When using a different navigational model it is important to be aware of the owner of the data class and the target must be&nbsp;the same object.</p><p>Mandatory arguments which are needed in the url are only CLASS. When using this BF to store availability on a different owner class than Contract the<br />implementation team needs to send in TARGET as well.</p>
