  DESCRIPTION: "<p>This BF is used to display the allocated numbers for well and its\
    \ connected perforation interval(s) based on the selected facility after a successful\
    \ allocation run.</p><p>A successful well allocation run will provide the allocated\
    \ quantities and the reconciliation factor for the well. The reservoir allocation\
    \ will then use the well's allocated quantities to calculate the allocated quantities\
    \ of the connected perforation interval(s).</p>\n\t<p><b>Data section 1:</b> \"\
    Well Allocated Data\" will display the allocated quantities for the well.</p>\n\
    \    <p><b>Data section 2:</b> \"Perforation Interval Allocated Data\" will display\
    \ the allocated quantities for the perforation interval(s) connected to the selected\
    \ well in data section 1.</p>"
