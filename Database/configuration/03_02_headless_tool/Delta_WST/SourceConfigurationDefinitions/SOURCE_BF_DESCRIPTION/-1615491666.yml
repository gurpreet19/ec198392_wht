  DESCRIPTION: <p>Mismeasurement Events are used to keep track of data modifications due to mismeasurement occurrences. If the data requires an event, whenever you modify the data you have to link to a mismeasurement event as revision event for that modification. This “Revision Event” is showing in the Record Status tab as a popup field at the bottom of each screen. To link an event you have to choose an event from the popup of “Revision Event” and save it. To enable or disable the “Require Event” flag, you can go to the “Class Validation” or “Object Validation” screen to configure it. “Require Event” is set on attribute level of the class or object.</p><p>In the Mismeasurement Event screen you can create and maintain events. For each event, you can attach some files and view them. The popup of the “Revision Event” field at the bottom of each screen will show all the valid mismeasurement events, valid meaning the event is not closed and in the valid period.</p>
