  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen is used to maintain forecasting Contract input as export values from contract / delivery point. Ordinarily, these values would be loaded into the system&nbsp;via messages, typically from a coordinator who collect forecast values from the production units. However this screen may be used to view, edit, delete or add&nbsp;values. Existing values can be modified and new values for new events (dates) can be added. The values are stored per contract. Depending on which combination&nbsp;of those is selected in the navigator, different sets of data will be shown in the data section.</p><p>The user selects a date range, Business Unit and [or Contract Area or Contract] and Forecast and Series, from the navigator at the top of the screen and presses&nbsp;the &ldquo;Go&hellip;&rdquo; button. The planning period details are then populated in the Forecast Input Contract [FCST_CNTR_DAY_STATUS] table. It is now possible to add, edit&nbsp;or delete values for individual planning periods in the Forecast Input Contract table.</p>
