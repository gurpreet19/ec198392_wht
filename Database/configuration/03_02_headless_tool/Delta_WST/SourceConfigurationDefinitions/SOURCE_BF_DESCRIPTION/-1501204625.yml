  DESCRIPTION: <p>The Business Function allows users to investigate conditions where operational nominations contribute to the total scheduled outflow from each terminal or Location point. New and already reported nominations are presented both as daily rates and hourly rates. The upper table shows the daily rates. Selecting a Location from the upper table will unveil related hourly rates in the lower table.</p><p>UOM by default will be picked from nomination Location&nbsp;(Deliver Point, Delivery Stream), the Unit will be picked from attribute oper_uom.</p><p>The Graph in second data section display hourly Scheduled Nominations against Best Available Nominations&nbsp;(Accepted, Adjusted or confirmed) depending on the available stage.</p><p>To use this business functions to view location per Delivery Stream or Delivery Point the implementation projects can create a new treeview entry with arguments on the URL. The TARGET argument is used in the navigator, while the CLASS argument is used for the table data sections. It is a requirement that the TARGET can be found in a navigation model, and that the target is the owner of the data in the CLASS. Mandatory arguments which are needed in the url are CLASS and SUB_CLASS.. The navigation model can be forced by the project by using NAV_MODEL argument.</p><p>The project can model new Navigator e.g. Business Unit, Transport System, Transport Zone, Nomination Location. The Navigator can be modelled that the Nomination Location will be able to show Entry or Exit or Inside Location.</p><p>The Business function supports profiling on Nomination Location, grouping nomination locations to belong to a certain profile. But profiling does not work on two different objects e.g. having Nomination Location and Nomination Point using profile Mechanism only one type of object can use profiling at each screen.</p>
