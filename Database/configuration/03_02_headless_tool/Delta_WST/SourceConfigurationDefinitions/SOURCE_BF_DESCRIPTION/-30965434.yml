  DESCRIPTION: <p>The “Incoming Messages” screen is used by end–users when they want to put a message from an external actor into the EC data loading queue. Only messages that require manual acknowledgment appears in this screen. When the message appears in this screen, the message may have gone through a transformation according to the <strong>MHM.0003 – Value Translation Maintenance Design Document</strong>. The "View Original" and "View Converted" buttons open a new window and displays the corresponding message.</p><p>It is possible to accept and reject messages at this stage. Rejected messages will be removed from the list and is given status “Not Loaded” in the Message journal screen. Accepted messages will proceed to the correct recipient.</p><p>A freetext message does not contain data of interest to load into EC. Thus, an acknowledgement of a freetext message will not result in data loading. It is merely a mechanism to be able to support a simple workflow for this message category.</p><p>It is possible to select many messages at once and put them into the loading queue in bulk. Use CTRL+Left click to select multiple messages.</p>
