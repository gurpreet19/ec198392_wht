  DESCRIPTION: <p>For all parties entitled to lift from any of the storage systems defined, one or more accounts must exist. The account is just like a bank account &ndash; one can insert and&nbsp;withdraw from the account, and the purpose of the account handling is exactly to keep full records of what has been inserted and withdrawn.</p><p>Consequently, for each storage system, the account status provides an overview at lifter level and for all associated accounts and their positions at start of month&nbsp;(opening balance) and end of month (closing balance).</p><p>The Monthly Account Status business function will for each lifting account show opening balance, production share, lifted quantity, adjustments and closing balance.&nbsp;The opening balance is equal to the closing balance from previous month. All other fields are calculated. The main purpose for this business function is to approve&nbsp;the closing balance for each lifting account.</p><p>The user approves the Closing Balance by pressing the &lsquo;Close Lifting Account&rsquo; button. This button is calling a User Exit which by default call<br />EcBp_Lift_Acc_Balance.setClosingBalance to perform set of validations. This procedure allowed for further implementation, for example, to support re-closing action&nbsp;for the closed Lifting Account. Before approving, all adjustments must be completed, cargos must be closed and production share must exists (Monthly Allocation&nbsp;must exist in the EC Transport).</p><p><ul style="list-style-type:disc">Closing the Lifting Account will fail if:<li>previous month is not closed</li><li>all cargos are not closed (there exists cargos with cargo status not closed, no bill of lading and nominated date in the same month).</li><li>receipts for storages and commercial entity is missing (production share)</li><li>equity share is missing</li><li>close a month if next month is closed</li></ul></p><p>Note that if the Storage type on storage is &lsquo;Import&rsquo; then the calculation for closing balance is reversed. Meaning that lifting&rsquo;s goes into the storage and<br />forecast/official numbers goes out of the storage.</p>
