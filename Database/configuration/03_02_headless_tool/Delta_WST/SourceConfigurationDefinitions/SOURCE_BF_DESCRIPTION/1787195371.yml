  DESCRIPTION: <p>The screen is configuration screen for Lifting Activity Code. This is the template used when instantiating the activity timesheet. All rows marked for instantiation will&nbsp;be instantiated in the timesheet. All other rows are optional in the timesheet and can be added. Activities with demurrage code are always instantiated. The&nbsp;demurrage code is used by the demurrage screen. Hence, when the configuration is done, there must be a row for all demurrage codes configured in the system.</p>
