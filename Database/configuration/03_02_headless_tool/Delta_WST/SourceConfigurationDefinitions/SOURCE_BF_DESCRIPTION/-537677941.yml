  DESCRIPTION: <p>This is a generic screen; see the description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p><p>Tanks are used to store Products from the oil and gas production, and not Chemical Products. Products and Chemical Products are not the same.</p><p>Tanks can have a single product, like propane or sulfur, but Tanks can also have oil which contains more or less water in the oil or as a free water layer in the bottom of the tank. Tanks in EC can, therefore, be for either one single product or for two products where one have to be water.</p><p>Tanks having the same product are normally connected to Storage. Reporting from Storage will automatically sum all Tank data and report total Storage. However, Storage is a logical grouping of Tanks and Storage do not have its own data. One Tank can, in fact, belong to more than one Storage at the same point in time. This could be handy for reporting but should be configured carefully to avoid errors in volumetric Storage reporting.</p><p>The closing inventory can be determined in many different ways. See Tank attributes for more details. The closing inventory for a day is always deemed to be the end of the production day, even though it isn't possible to physically dip many different Tanks exactly at end of production day when the process is a manual process.</p><p>It is recommended to create one Storage for each Product, even if there is only one Tank, one Product, and one Storage. Further, it's recommended to create derived Streams that holds the change in total Storage from day to day. This ''delta storage'' Stream is often used in the allocation to get correct total produced quantities.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after:avoid">When a tank has a floating roof, the liquid volume displaced by the roof can be accounted for in calculating the tank's inventory. The physical construction of the tank can also control the possible range the roof displacement could be accounted for, typically at the bottom of the tank as described in the figure below.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after:avoid"><img src="/onlinehelp/img?type=description&bfDescNo=CO.0036&imgNo=8&dataLevel=2&pfdrid_c=true" class="ecImg"></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after:avoid"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">The different ranges and calculations supported by EC are:<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after:avoid"><b><i>Roof floating:<o:p></o:p></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:" arial",sans-serif"="">If dip level > ROOF_SOAK_UPPER_LIMIT</span></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"><img src="/onlinehelp/img?type=description&bfDescNo=CO.0036&imgNo=4&dataLevel=2&pfdrid_c=true" class="ecImg"></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after:avoid"><b><i><br></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after:avoid"><b><i>Roof in Critical Zone<o:p></o:p></i></b></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:" arial",sans-serif"="">If dip level BETWEEN ROOF_SOAK_LOWER_LIMIT AND ROOF_SOAK_UPPER_LIMIT <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"><img src="/onlinehelp/img?type=description&bfDescNo=CO.0036&imgNo=5&dataLevel=2&pfdrid_c=true" class="ecImg"></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after:avoid"><b><i><br></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after:avoid"><b><i>Roof below soaking zone<o:p></o:p></i></b></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:" arial",sans-serif"="">If dip level < ROOF_SOAK_LOWER_LIMIT</span></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"><img src="/onlinehelp/img?type=description&bfDescNo=CO.0036&imgNo=6&dataLevel=2&pfdrid_c=true" class="ecImg"></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:" arial",sans-serif"=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Code" style="page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:" arial",sans-serif"=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after:avoid"><br></p>
