  DESCRIPTION: <p>The Class Relation Configuration&nbsp;screen provides an interface for editing of class&nbsp;relation properties.</p><p>At the top of the screen is a navigator where the user can select the relation from- and to-classes along with the role name.</p><p>At the bottom of the screen is a "Generate All Class Views" button&nbsp;and, after navigating to a specific class relation, a "Generate Class View" button.</p><p>These buttons&nbsp;are used to regenerate all class views or only the class view of the current&nbsp;class. This is typically used when a relation is being modified, added or deleted. If, for some reason, the regenerating of the view fails, the error message is written to table T_TEMPTEXT with id GENCODEERROR. An error message will be displayed to the user, but note that the view will contain errors and other users can be affected by it.</p><p>If the view generation is ok the changes are available to all users right away.</p>
