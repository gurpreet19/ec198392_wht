  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to view or override the default split on Lifting Agreements.</p><p>If the Lifting Account is set up to be connected to a contract and that contract got more than one customer, a default split is created when the nomination is created.</p><p>Nominations for selected cargo in navigator are listed. If the nomination is connected to a Lifting Agreement, the split data section will list all customer companies&nbsp;associated to the Lifting Agreement (Contract). The default split is retrieved from the Contract Parties business function. If no override on the split, the &lsquo;Default Split&rsquo;&nbsp;and the &lsquo;New Split&rsquo; will be the same. The &lsquo;Nomination Qty&rsquo; is calculated based on the nominated quantity on the nomination and the &lsquo;New Split&rsquo; attribute.</p><p>It is possible to insert multiple splits for the same lifter if the lifter needs to deliver same cargo load to multiple port. For this purpose, the class trigger in STOR_LIFT_NOM_CPY_SPLIT needs to be disabled to allow multiple split entry, or project can specify their own logic in ue_Storage_Lift_Nomination.validateSplitEntry.</p>
