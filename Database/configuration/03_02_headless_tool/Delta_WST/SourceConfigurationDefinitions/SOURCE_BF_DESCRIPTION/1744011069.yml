  DESCRIPTION: <p>The user selects a date(-span), an allocation network, and a job as parameters to the allocation process.</p><p>Daily allocation jobs will be invoked within the range &lsquo;<em>From date&rsquo; </em>to &lsquo;<em>To date&rsquo;</em>. The &lsquo;To date&rsquo; is inclusive in the range. The &lsquo;<em>From date&rsquo; </em>can be null, or if it is not null it must be before the &lsquo;<em>To </em>date&rsquo;, or else a warning will be displayed, and no allocation will take place. For each day in the range a new row will be inserted in table holding allocation runs. It should be noted that if the &lsquo;<em>From date&rsquo; </em>is prior to the start date of an allocation network, the allocation network will not be shown in the <em>Allocation Network </em>navigator. Only networks configured with one of the daily period codes will be visible in the Allocation Network navigator. Similarly, only allocation jobs with period equal day will be visible in the Allocation Job navigator.</p><p>Changing fields in navigator must be populated to the rest of the screen, incl. Run Allocation button, by pressing the Go&hellip; button. If changes done in navigator without pressing Go&hellip; the user will be notified when pressing the Run Allocation button. To run an allocation, all fields of navigator must be filled. There are also Logging level-popup to choose log level and Simulate-checkbox. Log Level is default to &lsquo;No Details&rsquo;. Simulate-checkbox is checked to perform a simulation, and no checkmark results in a normal allocation. When "Run Calculations" button is pressed, there will be a check for all dependant Status Processes. A Pop up message will be raised if there are dependant Status Process that have not been executed during that period. The allocation is run in the background, it is an asynchronous job, thus it is necessary to refresh the screen to see the new run as a row in screen when the allocation is finished. Both daily and monthly allocation screens have a list of the running allocation jobs.</p><p>Confirmation message will be prompted prior to running an allocation if the flag is set to true in Maintain System Settings (CO.1006) for the property Allocation Screens - Confirmation Message.</p><p>When a row in the log list is selected a summary of the log is shown below. The full log can be downloaded in raw format by clicking the Download button.</p><p>When a successful monthly or daily run has been approved, the approved daily allocation can be re-run on the approved network or any of its sub-network if the system property flag &ldquo;Allow re-running of Approved calculation&rdquo; in Maintain System Settings is set to &lsquo;Y&rsquo;. It is possible to save comments on the run, both the successful and the failed runs. It is possible to delete a row holding the status of a particular allocation run.</p><p>User is allowed to run allocation when a month is locked. This could be configured in System Attribute =>ALLOW_ALLOC_LOCK_MONTH.</p><p>View Configuration Button :</p><p>Upon clicking on this button,  a read-only popup window will be opened. This popup window will allow users to view the objects (wells/streams/well hookups/facilities) that were used in the selected allocation run. When an object is selected, the users will see the configuration(s) that were valid for the applicable date/period. Users will also be able to view Stream Set List and Stream Formula configurations for streams.</p><p>When a Status Process is configured in Allocation Job Status Process Connection Screen (CO.0200) for the selected Allocation job, you cannot start the Allocation Job for&nbsp; the period until the Status Process has been run. A Popup error message will be prompted displaying required process that needs to be executed when "Run Calculation" button is clicked.&nbsp;</p>
