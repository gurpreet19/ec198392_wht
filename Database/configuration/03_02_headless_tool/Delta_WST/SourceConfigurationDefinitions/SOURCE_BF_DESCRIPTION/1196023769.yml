  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Node screen</strong>    is used in different modules
    within EC.</p><p>    <strong> In EC Revenue: </strong><br>    Node represents
    the inventory balancing points such as pipelines and    storages.</p><p>    <strong>
    In EC Production: </strong> <br>    Nodes are the connection points in an Allocation
    Network.</p><p>    All node objects have an associated <strong> Calculation Rule.
    </strong><br>    The calculation rule defines a set of calculations that will
    be performed    on the node''s stream data.<br>    The allocation process visits
    each node in the allocation network and    executes the calculation logic defined
    by the node''s associated calculation    rule.</p><p>    While most Nodes are
    implicit nodes, meaning that the object itself is a    Facility Class 1 or Facility
    Class 2, some nodes have to be explicit nodes.    That is when you create a Node
    using Node Screen. Nodes created here are    explicit nodes.</p><p>    For detailed
    information about the calculation rules available in EC    Production, documentation
    can be generated and viewed in the Maintain    Calculation Rule.</p>'
