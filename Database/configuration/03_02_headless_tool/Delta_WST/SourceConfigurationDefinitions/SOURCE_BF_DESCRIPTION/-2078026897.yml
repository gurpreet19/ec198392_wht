  DESCRIPTION: <p>The &quot;Event Tank Status - VCF Calc&quot; business function is used when there is no calculated closing volume available for the tank and you want to record many tank readings for each day. Input to this business function is strapping heights for both liquid level and water level. The observed temperature and gravity is used to call the API program to determine the correct gravity and Volume Correction Factor (VCF). The VCF, BS&amp;W and strapping tables are used to calculate closing net oil and water for the day.</p><p>The data recorded in this BF is for information only, the official closing end of production day reading must be recorded in one of the daily tank BF&rsquo;s and not here.</p><p>The observed temperature, gravity, pressure and density are used to call the API calculation to determine the Corrected Gravity, Corrected Density and VCF. The tank must have VCF method configured as API (Calc. using API library) in order to access the API procedure.</p><p>In this API procedure, the temperature to calculate the VCF will first consider the &quot;Run Temp&quot;. If this is null, it will look for &quot;Observed Temp&quot;. One of these temperature values will then be used to calculate the VCF (refered as VCF Temp).</p><p>The VCF calculation further depends on the Tank configuration (CO.0036) for the Observed Density, Corrected Gravity and Corrected Density methods.</p><p>The first scenario to consider is when the Observed Density Method is &quot;API gravity to kg/sm3&quot;. The VCF calculation will be calculated by using the VCF Temp, Observed Pressure and Corrected Gravity. Corrected Gravity is obtained based on the Tank Configuration (CO.0036) as below:-</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Measured - will use Corrected Gravity as entered in the screen</li><li>Calculated - will be calculated by using the Observed Gravity, Observed Temp and Observed Pressure</li><li>Stream Sample Analysis - will use the valid Gravity from the approved analysis from Stream Sample Analysis  (PO.0032.01)</li></ul><p>The second scenario is when the Observed Density Method is other than &quot;API&quot;. The VCF calculation will be calculated by using the VCF Temp, Observed Pressure and Corrected Density. Corrected Density is obtained based on the Tank Configuration (CO.0036) as below:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Measured - will use Corrected Density as entered in the screen</li><li>Calculated - will be calculated based on Observed Density, Observed Temp, Observed Pressure and  Temperature Base (REF_TEMP_BASE from System Attributes (CO.1012))</li><li>Stream Sample Analysis - will be taken from Density in Stream Sample Analysis (PO.0032.01)</li></ul><p>These 2 scenarios has been tested against the API Standards Chapter 11.1.6 and 11.1.7. Below are the accepted units which can be used in EC for VCF calculation:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Temperature - Celsius or Fahrenheit</li><li>Pressure - any unit as the procedure will convert it to PSIG</li><li>Density - kg/m3</li></ul></p><div class="ui-widget"><div class="ui-datatable-tablewrapper"><table role="grid" cellpadding="10"><thead><tr role="row"><th class="ui-state-default" role="columnheader" aria-label="Property" scope="col"><span>User Input</span></th><th class="ui-state-default" role="columnheader" aria-label="Usage" scope="col"><span>Tank Configuration<span></th><th class="ui-state-default" role="columnheader" aria-label="Usage" scope="col"><span>Tested According to Standards</th></tr></thead><tbody class="ui-datatable-data ui-widget-content"><tr class="ui-widget-content ui-datatable-even" role="row"><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Observed Temperature (&deg;F)</li><li>Observed Pressure</li><li>Observed Gravity</li></ul></span></td><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Observed Density = API gravity to kg/sm3</li><li>Corrected Gravity = Calculated</ul></span></td><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>11.1.6.1.1</li><li>11.1.6.1.2</li></ul></span></td></tr><tr class="ui-widget-content ui-datatable-even" role="row"><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Observed Temperature</li><li>Observed Pressure</li><li>Observed Density</li></ul></span></td><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Observed Density = Measured</li><li>Corrected Density = Calculated</li></ul></span></td><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>11.1.6.2.2</li></ul></span></td></tr><tr class="ui-widget-content ui-datatable-even" role="row"><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Observed Temperature (&deg;F)</li><li>Observed Pressure</li><li>Observed Density</li></ul></span></td><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Observed Density = Measured</li><li>Corrected Density = Stream Sample Analysis</li></ul></span></td><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>11.1.6.3.2</li></ul></span></td></tr><tr class="ui-widget-content ui-datatable-even" role="row"><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Observed Temperature (&deg;C)</li><li>Observed Pressure</li><li>Observed Density</li></ul></span></td><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Observed Density = Measured</li><li>Corrected Density = Calculated</li></ul></span></td><td role="gridcell"><span><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>11.1.7.1.1</li></ul></span></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p style="font-size:small;">* Test scenarios above are based on the scenarios defined in the Standards.</p><p>&quot;Calculated All Not Approved&quot; button will calculate the VCF similar to &quot;Calculate Selected&quot;.
