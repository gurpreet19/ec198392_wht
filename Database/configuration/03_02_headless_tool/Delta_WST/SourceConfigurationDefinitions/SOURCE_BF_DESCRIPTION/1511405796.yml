  DESCRIPTION: <p>A carrier will be cleared to doc at selected ports based on certain criteria&rsquo;s such as compatibility with the port/terminal, quality assurance of the vessel and the vessel operator, environmental standards etc. This business function is used to set up ports where a carrier, for a period of time, has been approved to doc. Theses sets of ports will also be associated with a round-trip time unique for each carrier. The port acceptance and round-trip time are vital when calculating carrier availability for Annual Delivery Plan (ADP) generation.</p><p>The first data section displays Terminals (Facility Class 1) and Destination Ports for a carrier selected in the navigator, together with the Round-Trip times and date period in which this carrier is contractually accepted at these locations. A carrier can be accepted at multiple Terminals/Ports and timer periods can be overlapping. The second data section reports other vessels also accepted at the selected Terminal (Facility Class 1).</p>
