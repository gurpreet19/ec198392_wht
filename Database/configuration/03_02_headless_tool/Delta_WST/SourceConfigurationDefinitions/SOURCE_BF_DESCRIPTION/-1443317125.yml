  DESCRIPTION: <p>Any unplanned delay or abort of the lifting operation must be recorded as a delay. Meaning, delays are events not already covered in the cargo activity time sheet.&nbsp;Typical examples are weather conditions, oil-spill, etc. For a delay, the delay period (from/to), type of delay (delay code) and originator is recorded. Elapsed time is&nbsp;calculated based on delay period. Originator indicates who is responsible for the delay, and may be used in further demurrage calculations.</p>
