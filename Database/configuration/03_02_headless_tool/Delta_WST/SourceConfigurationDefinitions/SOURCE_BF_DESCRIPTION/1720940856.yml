  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Document Properties screen</strong>    defines the
    various documents that can be generated for a contract. Each document setup will
    have a set of attributes and relations which will be used as    basis when creating
    a document from the contract during Contract Processing. Any number of documents
    can be defined for a contract.</p><p>    The documents defined will follow the
    versioning defined for the Contract itself, i.e. when creating a new version of
    the Contract the system will also    create new versions of the Document Setup
    defined here.</p><p>    The BF is divided into following sections:<br>    <strong><em>-
    </em></strong>    <strong><em>Filter Navigator:</em></strong><br>    The Filter
    Navigator lists all the contracts being valid at the date selected in the Filter
    Navigator. By clicking a contract object in the Filter    Navigator all the documents
    defined for the contract will be listed in the Document List section.<br>    <strong><em>-
    </em></strong>    <strong><em>Document List:</em></strong><br>    The Document
    List lists all the documents defined for the selected contract. By clicking a
    Document the document attributes and relations will be listed in    the Document
    Details section.<br>    <strong><em>- Version Display:</em></strong><br>    This
    section shows the version dates of the selected document setup. The versions of
    the document setup follow the versions of the contract itself.<br>    <strong><em>-
    Document Details:</em></strong><br>    This section of the screen lists all the
    attributes and relations defined for a document.</p><p>    <strong style="color:
    rgb(0, 0, 153);">Invoice Number:</strong><br>    The user can define the Invoice
    Number format for each Document Setup. The Invoice Number can be constructed using
    a combination of fixed text and    variables. Each variable is identified by a
    starting $-sign.<br>    <em>The variables supported by the system are:</em><br>    -
    $DOC_SEQ_NO - Sequence<br>    - $COUNTRY_CODE<br>    - $DDD - Document Date DAY<br>    -
    $DMM - Document Date MTH<br>    - $DYY - Document Date Year - 2 digits<br>    -
    $DYYYY - Document Date Year - 4 digits<br>    - $SDD - System Date DAY<br>    -
    $SMM - System Date MTH<br>    - $SYY - System Date Year - 2 digits<br>    - $SYYYY
    - System Date Year - 4 digits<br>    - $MANUAL - The invoice number will be manually
    entered through Document General screen (BF SP.0016). - The manually entered invoice
    number must be unique.    (Please note that the $MANUAL variable cannot be combined
    with any other of the pre-defined variables.) </p><p><em style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Example:</strong></em></p><em><p>    INVOICE_NUMBER
    = P/01/12/$DOC_SEQ_NO/$DYYYY will give invoice number P/01/12/1000023/2006. If
    the current sequence number is 1000023 and the document date    is a date in year
    2006. The DOC_SEQ_NO is a sequence number defined in the database. There is one
    sequence for FINAL type of documents and one for ACCRUAL    type of documents:</p><p>    CONT_DOC_NO_SP_FINAL<br>    CONT_DOC_NO_SP_ACCRUAL<br>    The
    default Invoice Number format: $COUNTRY_CODE$DOC_SEQ_NO </em> <br><br>    <span

    </em></strong>    <strong><em>Manual: </em></strong><br>    The user will enter
    the Base Amount manually. The <em>From Date</em> and <em>To Date</em> need to
    be entered by the user. The save operation will calculate    the Interest Line

    setting is for handling multi-step invoicing where the current step includes Interest
    Line Items for invoicing an interest charge for the transaction    difference
    from the previous invoice to the current invoice.<br>    - The Base Amount of
    the Interest Line Item will be the sum of the line item values of the current
    TRANSACITON and its PRECEDING TRANSACTION except the    Interest Line Item itself.
    The <em>From Date</em> will be set to the due date of the preceding document.
    The <em>To Date</em> will be set to the due date    of the current document.<br>-
