  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to view and update Operational Contract Accounts.</p><p>The data section is built on daily Inventory table and transaction table. The Accounts which belong to the same daytime, location and contract will be displayed in the&nbsp;same row; columns are displayed as a cross tab /matrix. The Accounts can be adjusted using the Debit or Credit.</p><p>The Debit and Credit attributes will increase and decrease the inventory. The screen will keep track of the accumulative balance of the inventory.</p><p>The business function is similar to the GD.0032 - Daily Contract Location Inventory, but it displays the Inventory columns as a cross tab /matrix and combines two&nbsp;data sections into one.</p><p>Insert and delete is not supported. To get daily meter values the records needs to be instantiated or inserted in GD GD.0032 - Daily Contract Location Inventory.</p><p>To use this business functions it is a requirement that the TARGET can be found in a navigation model, and that the target is the owner of the data in the CLASS.</p><p>Mandatory arguments which are needed in the url are CLASS and SUB_CLASS. The navigation model can be forced by the project by using NAV_MODEL<br />argument.</p><p>The Business function supports profiling on Contract, grouping Contracts objects that belong to a certain profile. But profiling does not work on two different objects&nbsp;eg having Contract and Contract Inventory using profile Mechanism; only one type of object can used profiling at each screen.</p>
