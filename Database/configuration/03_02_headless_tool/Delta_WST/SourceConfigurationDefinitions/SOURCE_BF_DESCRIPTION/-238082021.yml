  DESCRIPTION: '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"> <em> <u> For the EC Financial
    Documents there are 3 key dates that EC can determine automatically based on configuration:
    </u> <br>       <strong> - Document Date </strong> (Document Date Term screen
    - BF CD.0107), <br> <strong>- Document Received Date </strong> (Document Received
    Term screen - BF CD.0108), <br>    <strong> - Payment Date </strong> (Payment
    Term screen - BF CD.0023).</em></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
    <em>EC uses a concept called Date Term to be able to determine these dates. <u>
    This works as follows: </u> </em></span></p><p>  <img src="/onlinehelp/img?type=description&bfDescNo=CD.0107&imgNo=1&dataLevel=2&pfdrid_c=true"
    class="ecImg" style="font-size: 10pt;"></p><p>    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0,
    153);"><em><u>The logic contains 2 main elements:</u></em></span></p><p>    <span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><em><strong>1. Starting Point</strong> - the date
    the Term is calculated from to get to the Target Date.</em></span></p><p><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"> <em>The Starting Point is a date that can be given
    by another date in the financial document, such as Document Date, Bill of Lading
    Date, etc. The setting of the starting point is disconnected from the Date Term
    object itself. This way the same Date Term can be used with different starting
    points. The starting point is defined for each Document Setup for the various
    Date Terms by the Document Date Base Code / Document Received Date Base Code /
    Payment Term Date Base Code attribute which can be set to Document Date, Bill
    of Lading Date, etc.</em></span></p><p>    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><em><strong>2.
    Term itself</strong> - the rule to get to the Target Date (Document Date / Document
    Received Date / Payment Date).</em></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0,
    153);"><em> The Term has various methods to get to the Target Date which may include
    Calendar Days vs Business Days. <br>In case the Date Term includes Business Days
    then a Calendar object needs to be defined.</em></span></p><p>    <strong style="font-size:
    large;">Document Date Term screen</strong> is used to manage all the Document
    Date Terms available in the system. <br>The Document Date Term is used for calculating
    a Document Date for a Financial Document. <br>The concept is that the Document
    Date can be calculated by the system or be set to one of the other dates in a
    Financial Document.</p><p>    <u>Note:</u> The daytime used when creating a Document
    object (the Document Date data entry) will be the initial Document Date for the
    document and versioned configuration data from Contract / Document Setup / Transaction
    Templates / etc. will be picked based on this initial date. After the Document
    object has been created the Document Date Term will be executed and the Document
    Date may be changed according to the Document Date Term. <br>EC has a number of
    different methods to set the Document Date and typically the Document Date can
    be set to follow one of the other dates in the Document.</p><p>    <u>The Document
    Date Term has these methods:</u> <br>    <u>Note:</u> The terms First and Last
    refer to the earliest / latest dates found in the Transactions if there are different
    dates found.</p><p>    <strong><em>- First Discharge Commenced Date</em></strong>
