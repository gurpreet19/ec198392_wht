  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to start the price calculation jobs, and further to view the execution logs.</p><p>The typical usage of this business function is to view the execution log for scheduled price calculation jobs. To view the execution log, select Date, Price Group and&nbsp;Calculation Job. The job details are displayed in new rows on the screen, one for each run, along with the outcome (e.g. Success of Failure). By highlighting a row&nbsp;from the upper section of the screen, i.e. an individual calculation run, the associated log file summary from that run is displayed in the lower section of the screen&nbsp;and the user can press the Download button to examine the full log file.</p><p>From this business function it is also possible to manually start price calculation jobs. To start job, select Date and Calculation Job. The job scope can be further&nbsp;narrowed by also selecting Price Group and Price Object, meaning only selected price objects will be available for the price calculation job. To schedule the job, Job&nbsp;Start Time is entered, and the &ldquo;Run Price Calculation&rdquo; button is pressed. All started price calculation jobs will show in the Running Jobs section (showing Start Time,&nbsp;Status). Several price calculations may run simultaneously, but only one for each calculation job.</p><p>There are also Logging level-popup to choose log level and Simulate-checkbox. Log Level is default to &lsquo;No Details&rsquo;. The &quot;Simulate&quot; tick box may be used to run the&nbsp;calculations and inspect the subsequent log file, but without writing any results back to the database.</p>
