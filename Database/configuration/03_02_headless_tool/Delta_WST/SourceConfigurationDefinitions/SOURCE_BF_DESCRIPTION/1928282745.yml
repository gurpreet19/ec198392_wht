  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used when monthly production well data are available per production well and the well is directly connected to a facility, without any intermediate flowline / pipeline systems.</p>
    <p>Data can be entered manually or automatically. The BF requires one entry per well per month, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all active producing wells. In addition to that, the production well is recognized by having attribute WELL_CLASS set to &lsquo;P&rsquo; (Producer) or &lsquo;PI&rsquo; (Producer and Injector).</p>
