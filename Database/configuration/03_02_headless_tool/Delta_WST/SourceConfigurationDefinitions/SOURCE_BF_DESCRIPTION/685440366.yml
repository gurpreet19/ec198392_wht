  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The Validation Overview by Facility screen will display an aggregated
    view of executed Check Rule validations. The first section lists all Check Rule
    groups. The status and summary of all Check Rule subgroups are aggregated up to
    the level above. This list is filtered by time period (From date / To date) and
    the operational group model down to Facility Class 1. Note that the screen only
    supports an operational group model.</p><p>Highlighting a group in the list will
    display all the Check Rule error log entries connected to this group and its descendant
    groups. If updating the Ignore flag and pressing the Save Log button, the flagged
    error log entries will be ignored when creating error/warning icons in the tree
    view.</p><p>Note that in this version the Validation Overview by Facility screen
    requires a root group parameter as an input parameter for the screen to function
    properly. So when the screen is defined it must include a query string containing
    a ROOT_GROUP parameter with a valid Check Rule Group. For example: <em>./com.ec.frmw.co.screens/validation_overview_group_model/ROOT_GROUP/D_ASSET_STATUS?screentemplate=/com.ec.frmw.co.screens/validation_overview_group_model
    </em></p><p>The purpose of this is to enable several Validation Overview screens
    with different access for given users?/roles.</p>'
