  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The Business Function is used to view available capacity compared
    with the total firm bookings on a Location. All quantities are presented both
    as daily rates and hourly rates. The upper data section shows the daily rates.
    Selecting Location Point from the upper table will unveil related hourly rates
    in the lower table.</p><p>EC will calculate total available remaining capacity
    for nomination, which may be a positive or negative quantity.</p><p>If the remaining
    available capacity is negative, project implementation will raise an alarm indicating
    that the total capacity is exceeded.</p><p>The screen shows bookings related to
    both the current and to the previous nomination cycle. Product supports two nomination
    stages Adjusted and Scheduled.</p><p>The Graph in second data section display
    hourly Scheduled Nominations against Best Available Nominations&nbsp;(Accepted,
    Adjusted or confirmed) depending on the available stage.</p><p>In the Second Data
    section of the screen there are two graphs available:<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>Hourly
    Capacity vs. Nomination: This graph shows the available Location Point Capacity
    per hour versus new nomination&nbsp;(current cycle) per hour in the form of two
    line graphs. All quantities are presented in Sm3.</li><li>Booking Profile:  This
    graph shows the same information as the first graph, now combined with two additional
    data sets showing a) total booked firm capacity per hour. The booked firm is displayed
    in the form of bar graphs. All quantities are presented in Sm3.</li></ul></p><p>To
    use this business functions to view location per Delivery Stream or Delivery Point
    the implementation projects can create a new treeview entry with arguments on
    the URL. The TARGET argument is used in the navigator, while the CLASS argument
    is used for the table data sections. It is a requirement that the TARGET can be
    found in a navigation model, and that the target is the owner of the data in the
    CLASS. Mandatory arguments which are needed in the url are CLASS and SUB_CLASS..
    The navigation model can be forced by the project by using NAV_MODEL argument.</p><p>The
    project can model new Navigator eg Business Unit, Transport System, Transport
    Zone, Nomination Location. The Navigator can be modelled that the Nomination Location
    will be able to show Entry or Exit  or Inside Location.</p><p>The Business function
    supports profiling on Nomination Location, grouping nomination locations to belong
    to a certain profile. But profiling does not work on two different objects eg
    having Nomination Location and Nomination Point using profile Mechanism only one
    type of object can use profiling at each screen.</p>'
