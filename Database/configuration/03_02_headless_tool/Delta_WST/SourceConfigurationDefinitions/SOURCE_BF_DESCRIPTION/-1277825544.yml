  DESCRIPTION: <p>The Report Generation screen provides functionality to generate, view, download and send reports, add message distribution lists and check send log. The Report Generation screen is a duplicate of the Report Administration screen, but it has been set as read only and doesn’t support inserting a new report. Only the date type report parameter is editable. This screen is used to generate a predefined report by different date (if the predefined report has date type parameter) and send the generated report.</p><p>The table below the report table lists all generated reports of the selected report with the same parameters as specified in the Report Parameters section.</p><p>When selecting a generated report, the tab below will show Parameter Values, Message distribution and Send log. Parameter Values shows all the “Late Binding” parameters for this run. These are parameters that have been specified for the report and hence sent to the report system when generating the report. Message distribution shows all the distribution lists which defined in the Distribution List screen and assigned to the selected report. Send Log shows the send log and recipients for selected generated report.</p><p>This business function provides functionality to distribute a report using the Send button on a generated report. To be able to distribute a report, it has to be linked to at least one distribution list. This can be done both inserting message distribution list in this screen or inside the message handling system. And it must be done before using the Send button. Otherwise, an error message will appear.</p><p>If any of the parameters have the “Check Access” activated and ring fencing is active, then a user will only see the reports having report parameter values which the user has access to. The user will also be prevented from generating reports having parameter values excluding access. Access check will only be done for parameters that do not have the values preset for the report definitions.</p><p>Publishing generated report functionality has been added to Report Administration screen. Report Generation as a duplicate screen, also inherits this function. It has been added “Publish Report” tab. Through this tab, user can insert Publish Report and Access Check Parameters to publish a selected generated report. Detail information and data model about publishing report can be found in RP.0003 – Report Administration.</p>
