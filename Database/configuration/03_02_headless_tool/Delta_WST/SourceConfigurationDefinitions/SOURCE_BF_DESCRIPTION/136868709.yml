  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This screen is designed for BPM administrators to upload their
    process files and deploy or undeploy their BPM project to the engine. It also
    provides a project overview to BPM users. In order to upload &amp; deploy or undeploy
    projects in the screen, the user must have a special role called JBPM.ADMIN.</p><p>Once
    the project is deployed to the engine, the Deployment Id, Operator and Date columns
    are autogenerated. The deployment id is composed of group id, artifact id and
    version. Thus, it is not allowed to have space or special characters in the group
    id, artifact id and version columns. The deployment id is used to identify the
    deployed project in the Process Template screen.</p><p>The second component shows
    an overview of the processes associated with the deployed project. It provides
    the following information of the processes:</p><ul><li>Name: Process name defined
    in the .bpmn2 file.</li><li>Process Id: Process Id used to identify the process
    in the system.</li><li>Process Instances: Number of all associated process instances
    including active, completed and aborted.</li><li>Active Instances: Number of active
    process instances.</li><li>Active Tasks: Number of active tasks.</li></ul>'
