  DESCRIPTION: <p>For long-term gas sales contract, it is quite common that an off-take forecast at various periodical levels is to be provided by the gas buyer. The background for this&nbsp;is for the seller to be able to plan / anticipate future gas supply demand to be delivered under the contract. Note however, that in most cases, such forecasts are not&nbsp;binding and does not impose and obligation on the buyer.</p><p>If the contract has multiple delivery points &ndash; then one forecast need to be provided per delivery point.</p><p>The periodical levels would typically be a forecasted annual off-take over the complete life-time (reflected in the contract ACQ clauses), a monthly/quarterly forecast&nbsp;for the coming gas year, a daily forecast for the coming week/month. Further, there is a need for hourly forecast per day during the week. Since gas demand tend&nbsp;to vary during the day (low at night, peak at morning/afternoon) and during the week (less industrial use during weekends), a Daily forecast at hourly level gives a&nbsp;good planning window for the gas seller and is therefore common in many sales agreements.</p><p>The Daily Gas Sales Forecast business function is a screen for entering/viewing gas supply forecast data. Basic DCQ (Daily Contract Quantity) and forecast<br />information will be listed for selected period, and contracts and delivery points satisfying the navigator selection. When selecting one day, hourly values for this day&nbsp;will be listed, if available. The DCQ might be an adjusted value applied in the screen &ndash; Planned Delivery Restrictions&nbsp;Data may be entered either on daily or hourly level, and will also be stored (independently) at both levels. When forecasting for a new period, first daily records&nbsp;must be created (&ldquo;Gen days&rdquo; button). If hourly forecast is wanted, hourly records must also be created (&ldquo;Gen hours&rdquo; button). Initial forecast values may be entered&nbsp;either at daily or hourly level. If values are entered at daily level, they will be automatically distributed to hourly level if hourly records are generated (&ldquo;Gen hours&rdquo;).</p><p>Whenever hourly level values are entered, these will override the daily values. As a consequence, daily values will not be editable if values exist on hourly level for&nbsp;the given day. Also, be aware that it is not possible to delete rows in this business function. This to avoid inconsistency vs. calculations performed on these data.</p><p>Data will be stored (independently) at both daily and hourly (if available) level. Data are to be entered in one consistent unit of measure. The unit of measure is&nbsp;defined in the gas sales contract, as an attribute.</p>
