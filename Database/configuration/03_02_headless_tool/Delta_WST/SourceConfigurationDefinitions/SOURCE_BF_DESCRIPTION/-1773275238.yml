  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Forecast Revenue Properties screen </strong>is used to
    define the Revenue Forecast Cases for the system.</p><p>FUNCTION_AREA_CODE = REVENUE_FORECAST</p><p>The
    Code attribute will uniquely identify a revenue forecast object.</p><p>The Name
    attribute is a more user-friendly version of the Code, and it does not have to
    be unique.</p><p>The Populate Method is either YEAR_TO_MONTH or PLAN. If the latter
    is chosen, then the populate logic does not look into the actual tables, which
    is the case if YEAR_TO_MONTH is chosen. This means that the PLAN alternative should
    be chosen if the purpose of the forecast case is an initial budget and YEAR_TO_MONTH
    if the purpose is a regular forecast case. The YEAR_TO_MONTH alternative will
    be described in more detail in later sections.</p><p>Year and month tell for which
    year and month the forecast case is. In the screenshot above the code attribute
    is set accordingly to the year and month. Note that this has to be done manually
    by the user.</p><p>The field group type attribute tells which type of field groups
    that should be available for selection when entering the data. This will be described
    later.</p><p>Scope tells whether this forecast case should be available to all
    users or only the user that created it. Available choices are PRIVATE and PUBLIC.
    If set to PRIVATE this forecast object will be visible only to the user who created
    it. Otherwise it is available to all users.</p><p>Official Forecast Case is either
    Y or N. Only one forecast case for a given month and year can be official. There
    are no restrictions when it comes to the number of unofficial forecast cases.</p><p>Quantity
    Forecast Reference tells from which quantity forecast case the quantity data and
    for which fields if applicable are members of the forecast case is to be copied.
    The revenue forecast case can only be set to official if the referenced quantity
    case is official.</p><p>Rules applying when connecting a QTY Forecast Case:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Given
    that the Revenue Forecast case is Official then it should only be allowed to connect
    an official Qty Forecast case.</li><li>&nbsp;If the Revenue Forecast case is Public,
    then it should only be allowed to connect a Public Qty Forecast Case</li><li>&nbsp;If
    the Revenue Forecast case is Private, then it should be possible to connect either
    a Private or a Public Qty Forecast Case</li><li>&nbsp;It should be possible to
    connect an Approved or a Provisional Qty Forecast case.</li><li>&nbsp;When you
    connect a Qty Forecast Case then its Plan Date, Populate Method, Official flag
    and Field Group Type should be copied to the Revenue Forecast Case.</li></ul><p>The
    Populate Forecast Case button will be described in more detail in the sections
    that describes the different forecast approaches.</p><p>The Copy Forecast Case
    button creates a copy of the selected forecast case. The code and name attribute
    will get a postfix (_COPY) compared to the original. The other attributes will
    be left as they are.</p><p>Through this BF the user can:</p><ul><li>Create new
    Revenue Forecast Cases - Create a completely new Revenue Forecast Case.</li><li>Modify
    Revenue Forecast Cases - Modify attributes of existing Revenue Forecast Cases.</li><li>Populate
    Revenue Forecast Cases - Populate Revenue Forecast Cases of type ''Closing Forecast''
    (POPULATE_METHOD = YEAR_TO_MONTH) with Final/Accrual data from the Quantities
    module.</li><li>Copy Revenue Forecast Cases - Copy an existing Revenue Forecast
    Case to a new Revenue Forecast Case. Attributes of the new Revenue Forecast Case
    can be modified.</li><li>Delete Revenue Forecast Cases - It is not allowed to
    delete a Revenue Forecast Case which is PUBLIC, set to OFFICIAL and has status
    APPROVED.</li></ul><p>The BF consists of these screen sections:</p><p><strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 71, 178);">Filter Navigator</strong></p><p>The YEAR selector
    of the Filter Navigator determines which forecast cases to show. It will list
    all Revenue forecast cases being valid for the selected year.</p><p>Lists only
    the forecast cases being PUBLIC or PRIVATE for the user logged in.</p><p><strong
