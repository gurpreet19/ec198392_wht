  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This screen is used to allow controlled collection point hierarchy reorganizations to occur and to avoid potentially serious mistakes due to incorrect manual SQL&nbsp; updates generated by various tools. It provides the ability to create a new version of the objects if the change is point forward. It also has the option to simply update all versions of the existing objects if that is desired.</p>
