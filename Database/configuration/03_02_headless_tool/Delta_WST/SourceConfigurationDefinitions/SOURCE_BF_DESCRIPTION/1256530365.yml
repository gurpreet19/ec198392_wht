    \ Royalty Calculations such as Monthly Royalty Calculation, Good Faith Estimate,\
    \ EOPS (End of Period Statement).<br>    - Yearly reports must be ran from January\
    \ to December.<br>    - The screen will display an error message if the dates\
    \ do not follow this requirement.<br>\t\t\t\t<u>Note:</u>    There is also an\
    \ identical screen for running Accruals. When running from this screen no Accruals\
    \ will be picked up for opening or preceding data.</p><h3>\t<strong>Calculations\
    \ Tab</strong>\t</h3><p>    This tab allows running a calculation using the data\
    \ from the Navigator.<br>    - The royalty can be ran with full logging to get\
    \ more details in the lower section.</p>\t\t\t\t<h3>\t\t<strong>Report Tab</strong>\t\

    \ starts with a reference with critical information fora calculation run. By deleting\
    \ the calculation run in the Calculations Tab the data here    will not be effected.\
    \ In other words it is possible to clear the Calculation Run Log without losing\
    \ the critical data related to the run. This enables    verifying a run even if\
    \ the log has been cleared.<br>\t\t<strong>Button <span style=\"color: rgb(0,\
    \ 153, 0);\">Verify Document</span>: </strong>    Approves the Calculation Run\

    \  Will set the Calculation back to Provisional making the data unavailable again.\
    \ This can only be done if the data has not been used yet, or the places    where\
    \ it has been used have been deleted.<br>\t\t<strong>Button <span style=\"color:\
