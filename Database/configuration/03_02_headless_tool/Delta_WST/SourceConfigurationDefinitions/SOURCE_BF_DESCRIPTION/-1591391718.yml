  DESCRIPTION: <p><strong>Stream - All screen</strong> is one of the fundamental screens in EC.</p><p><strong>Stream represents a flow of hydrocarbons from one Node to another.</strong></p><p>EC Revenue uses the same Stream object as the rest of the EC products.</p><p>Quantities generally are connected to the Streams in EC.</p><p><strong>For EC Revenue, </strong>it is slightly different as the quantities are held by instantiated records on a daily and monthly basis where these records are based on the Stream Item objects which then are connected to a Stream.</p><p>The Stream object has a long list of attributes that are mainly used by EC Production, only a few of them are used by EC Revenue. If the installation is purely an EC Revenue configuration then all other attributes and relations of the Stream object can be hidden from the screen by modifying the class attributes for the Stream class.</p>
