  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to get an overview of the entitlement over a period including liftings and production.&nbsp;</p><p>In Schedule Lifting Chart (CP.0002.01) there is a graphical presentation of the movements on storage for a month. In Estimate Monthly Account Status (CP.0012) the account&nbsp;status can be viewed on a monthly basis ahead of time. This business function combines these two business functions and gives all the details on a daily level.</p><p>By selecting a &lsquo;From Date&rsquo;, &lsquo;End Date&rsquo; and &lsquo;Storage&rsquo; in navigator the details can be viewed. It is not recommended to view more than three months.</p><p>The left part of the screen is more or less the same as in Schedule Lifting business function. The lifted values for all cargos and parcels are listed for the selected&nbsp;period. Together with the incoming production you will have the storage level for each day. For each date listing a cargo/parcel the corresponding lifting account&nbsp;name and closing balance are displayed. For Lifting Accounts that have the Lifting Agreement Indicator set the lifting account balance will be calculated as a sum of&nbsp;all sub-lifting accounts as set up in Nomination Split business function.</p><p>The numbers listed in this business function are maintained in a set of other business functions, e.g. to update the date/qty for planned lifting the corresponding&nbsp;cargo / parcel must be located in e.g. the &ldquo;CP.0003 &ndash; Cargo Information&rdquo;. If the cargo / parcel have actual lifting numbers, these will have precedence over planned&nbsp;dates/qtys. Actual numbers are maintained in the &ldquo;TO.0005 &ndash; BL/MR Info&rdquo; business function.</p><p>Note that if the Storage type on storage is &lsquo;Import&rsquo; then the calculation for storage level and lifting accounts are reversed. Meaning that lifting&rsquo;s goes into the storage&nbsp;and forecast/official numbers goes out of the storage.</p>
