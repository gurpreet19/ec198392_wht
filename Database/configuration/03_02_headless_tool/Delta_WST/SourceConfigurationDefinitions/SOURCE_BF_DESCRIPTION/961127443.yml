  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This business function is used to show the Debit and Credit of the selected pipeline and profit centre. The allocation will enter new records to the screen and thereby modify the total sum of all Debits and all Credits of a profit centre.</p>

    <p>This business function supports adjustments; it will resemble a simple bank system, on the pipeline and profit centre level. The table shown in screen keeps track of all transactions, and an additional class on top of that table will return the total balance, the sum of all Credits minus the sum of all Debits, for each pipeline and profit centre.</p>

    <p>The allocation will be mapped to write to the table shown in screen, and it reads the total balance of debit and credit for a profit centre through the additional class on top of the same table (this class will have the Balance for the records up to the daytime). The daytime column in the transaction screen tells for which hour there was created a debit (a delta calculated but not added to already calculated hour), and when it can typically be picked up by a daily reconciliation (created a credit).</p>

    <p>Typically this BF will be used to view the transactions that are done for assistance when calculating the manual adjustment. Transactions are posted both in the hourly re-running and in the daily reconciliation. During the hourly re-running the difference between the previously calculated allocation and the newly calculated allocation is written to the Debit column. In daily reconciliation that uses these hourly deltas the total that was picked up is written to the Credit column. There are individual deltas for each nomination point, represented by the profit centre object in screen.</p>
