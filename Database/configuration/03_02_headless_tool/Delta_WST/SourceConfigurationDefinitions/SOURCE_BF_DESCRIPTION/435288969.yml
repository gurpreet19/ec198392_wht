  DESCRIPTION: <p>The Check Rule screen provides an interface for editing, adding and deleting check rules.</p><p>A check rule is a rule that can be executed by EC to check for erroneous or questionable data. There is a predefined list of which objects and data that can have check rules. When defining a check rule, the goal is to make a WHERE clause that will return more than or equal to 1 row. The select part is always COUNT(*) and the only part that can be configured is the WHERE clause and which data view to query against.</p><p>Check rule icons in the treeview menu can be turned off by setting the system attribute CHECK_RULE_IN_MENU to "N".</p>
