  DESCRIPTION: "<p>This business function is used to maintain the seasonal factor\
    \ for the configured stream objects.</p>\n\n<p>Seasonal factor is a volume being\
    \ created for the various seasons within a year. It can be two seasons like summer\
    \ and winter or for more seasons in other instance.</p>\n\n<p>The configuration\
    \ of a season is made up of the combination of the attributes (Date and Valid\
    \ from), whereby the &ldquo;Date&rdquo; is always be the first day of the year\
    \ with the various &ldquo;Valid From&rdquo; date to indicate the start of each\
    \ season.</p>\n\n<p>The seasons within a year can be used repeatedly for many\
    \ years, and it can continue with another set of seasons with different year later.</p>\n\
    \n<p>In relation to stream object, there is a new gross volume method &ldquo;Seasonal\
    \ Volume&rdquo; and a new attribute &ldquo;Ref. Seasonal Stream&rdquo; being introduced\
    \ in stream object configuration screen.</p>\n\n<p>For seasonal gross volume calculation,\
    \ there are two ways you can configure it.</p>\n\n<p>1.\tYou can directly configure\
    \ a stream object with seasonal gross volume, and this stream object must be configured\
    \ in Stream Seasonal Values screen with factor. (Note: the &ldquo;Ref. Seasonal\
    \ Stream&rdquo; must be empty)</p>\n\n<p>2.\tYou can indirectly configure a stream\
    \ object with seasonal gross volume and with a referenced stream object set on\
    \ &ldquo;Ref. Seasonal Stream&rdquo; attribute whereby this referenced stream\
    \ object must be configured in Stream Seasonal Values screen with factor.</p>\n"
