  DESCRIPTION: "<p>This business function is used to create and maintain deferment\
    \ events and compensation events. Event data is filtered based on the date and\
    \ Scenario selected on the navigator.</p>\n\n\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\
    > Deferment Events</span></p>\n\n\t<p>This tab will maintain deferment event that\
    \ leads to production or injection not meeting planned production or injection.\
    \ A deferment can affect one single well only or multiple wells. The deferment\
    \ can lead to a full shut-in (Downtime deferment) of the well(s) or just a reduction\
    \ (Constraint deferment) of the well(s) flow rate. Deferments are classified and\
    \ categorized to be able to create reports explaining why production or injection\
    \ plans were not met.</p>\n\n\t<p>This tab is used to enter both downtime and\
    \ constraint deferments as defined below:</p>\n\n\t<p>- A Downtime deferment means\
    \ that the production is shut-in, not only reduced. </p>\n\n\t<p>- A Constraint\
    \ deferment means that the production is not shut-in, only reduced.</p>\n\n\t\
    <p>Both types of deferment events can be recorded against: </p>\n\n\t<p>- Single\
    \ well only </p>\n\n\t<p>- A set of wells (group). Deferment events for a set\
    \ of wells can be grouped using &lsquo;Parent&rsquo; which are Facility, Well\
    \ Hookup, Equipment and Tank.</p>\n\n\t<p>Single and group deferment events can\
    \ be assigned to the appropriate reason codes and the reason codes can be configured.\
    \ When a group well deferment event is recorded, individual wells may be added\
    \ manually or automatically by the system if the &lsquo;Populate Automatically&rsquo;\
    \ trigger is enabled.</p>\n\n\t<p>Calculate Deferment button is used to calculate\
    \ deferred volumes for the deferment events. The calculations shipped with the\
    \ product has the precedence as below:-</p><p> 1. Downtime event takes precedence\
    \ over Constraint events.</p>\n\n\t<p> 2. Single event takes precedence over Group\
    \ events.</p>\n\n\t<p> 3. Unscheduled events takes precedence over Scheduled events.</p>\n\
    \n\t<p> 4. Deferments that were opened at beginning of the day takes precedence\
    \ over deferment that happened during the day.</p>\n\n\t<p>The deferment will\
    \ be allocated on a daily basis, based upon the deferment events. This means that\
    \ for each deferment the deferred volume will be allocated back to wells, by event\
    \ and day in FCST_WELL_EVENT_ALLOC table.</p>\n\n\t<p>In addition, there is also\
    \ possibility of creating project/customer specific calculations in UE_FORECAST_EVENT\
    \ package.</p>\n\n\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Compensation Events</span></p>\n\
    \n\t<p>This tab will maintain compensation events which can be used on a daily\
    \ basis to offset delays in production due to an increase in shortfalls (Example:A\
    \ shortfall caused by the shutdown of one well (for various reasons) can be compensated\
    \ for by opening or unchoking another well) or to variations in treatment parameters\
    \ (Example: A gas well can be opened to compensate for the failure of a gas-lift\
    \ compressor). One or more such variations can arise at the same time for appropriate\
    \ reason codes and the reason codes can be configured.</p><div class=\"ui-widget-header\
