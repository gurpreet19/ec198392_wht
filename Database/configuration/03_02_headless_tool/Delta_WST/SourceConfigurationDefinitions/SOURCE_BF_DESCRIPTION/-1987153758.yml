  DESCRIPTION: <p>The gas demand from industrial and household can vary quite considerable from day to day and from season to season depending on ambient temperature, energy&nbsp;prices, shortfall in other energy sources, etc. Therefore gas is sold on flexible contracts allowing the buyer to vary the quantity to be deliver for a given day &ndash; and&nbsp;often also per hour within the day.</p><p>Buyers Nomination is the procedure in which gas buyers inform (&ldquo;nominate&rdquo;) the gas supplier of the quantity to be deliver for a given day (and often also per hour&nbsp;within the day). As opposed to the forecast, the nomination is legally binding and once a valid nomination is placed, it also constitutes an obligation to take the&nbsp;nominated amount.</p><p>Buyers will need to nominate for each contract and for each nomination point (if multiple nomination point agreed in contract).</p><p>The nomination procedure is defined in the sales contract and will always state the deadline for when a valid nomination can be made, typically 12-18 hours before&nbsp;the gas-day starts.&nbsp;Nominations will typically be constrained by an agreed minimum and maximum daily quantity, often expressed relative to a DCQ (Daily contracted quantity). For&nbsp;example that daily nomination must be within 40-110% of the DCQ. Moreover nominations can be constrained by a defined ramp-up rate, meaning that one need to&nbsp;move gradually rather than making big jumps in nomination quantity. Further there could be constraints on aggregate nominations (from all buyers) to observe&nbsp;capacity / technical constraints by the plant/delivery system. Any such constraints are defined in the gas sales agreement and can differ from contract to contract.</p><p>Several flexible contracts states that if the buyer fails to submit a valid nomination in time, then the supplier shall assume that the last previous valid nomination&nbsp;remains valid, but other contracts allowing for zero nomination could state that no nomination means zero. The proper handling of missing nominations must be&nbsp;contract-dependent and the sale agreement must be carefully examined when configuring the EC application.<br />Most gas sales arrangements with flexible off-take also have provisions for renominations, i.e. changes to the nomination after the nomination deadline.</p><p>Such&nbsp;changes are however normally to be treated on a &ldquo;best endeavour&rdquo; basis, meaning that the supplier will undertake to change if it does not impose any operation /&nbsp;commercial problem, normally to be determined on suppliers discretion. Renomination can typically be placed up to maybe 1-2 hours before the actual delivery. If&nbsp;the renomination is accepted, than this will override any previous proper nomination.</p><p>Data will be stored (independently) at both daily and hourly (if available) level. Data are to be entered in one consistent unit of measure. The unit of measure is&nbsp;defined in the gas sales contract, as an attribute.</p>
