  DESCRIPTION: "<p>This BF is used when either daily tank volume data or only strapping\
    \ height (for one single product) is available. Energy Components will automatically\
    \ create a new record for a new production day for all tanks having tank meter\
    \ frequency = &quot;DAY&quot;. For tanks having tank meter frequency = &quot;EVENT&quot;,\
    \ there will be no automatic instantiation, the user will have to manually press\
    \ the insert new record button and select the right tank from the tank drop down.\
    \ All data is treated as closing tank reading at the end of the production day.\
    \ Therefore there is no time associated with the reading.</p>\n\n<p>Opening volume\
    \ for a day is calculated as last available closing volume, for daily tanks it\
    \ will always be yesterday closing. If today is the tank&rsquo;s start day there\
    \ will be no value for yesterday&rsquo;s closing, and opening volume is set to\
    \ 0.</p>\n\n<p>If Strapping tables is used, it can return either mass or either\
    \ mass or volume, depending on the method configured for the tank. EC will calculate\
    \ the opposite unit if density is available, either entered manually or "
