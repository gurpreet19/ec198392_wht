  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This BF is used when either daily tank volume data or only strapping
    height (for one single product) is available. Energy Components will automatically
    create a new record for a new production day for all tanks having tank meter frequency
    = "DAY". For tanks having tank meter frequency = "EVENT", there will be no automatic
    instantiation, the user will have to manually press the insert new record button
    and select the right tank from the tank drop down. All data is treated as closing
    tank reading at the end of the production day. Therefore there is no time associated
    with the reading.</p><p>Opening volume for a day is calculated as last available
    closing volume, for daily tanks it will always be yesterday closing. If today
    is the tank�s start day there will be no value for yesterday�s closing, and opening
    volume is set to 0.</p><p>If Strapping tables is used, it can return either mass
    or either mass or volume, depending on the method configured for the tank. EC
    will calculate the opposite unit if density is available, either entered manually
    or as a reference value<span style="color: rgb(23, 43, 77);">.</span></p>'
