  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p>The user selects From Date, To Date, Allocation Network and Calculation Job as parameters to the allocation process.</p>

    <p>Sub daily allocation jobs will be invoked within the range &lsquo;From Date&rsquo; to &lsquo;To Date&rsquo;. The &lsquo;To Date&rsquo; is not inclusive in the range. For each sub day interval (a system setting what the sub day is, could be every 2nd hour, hourly, every 30 minutes etc) in the range a new row will be inserted in table holding allocation runs. Only network configured to be only &lsquo;Sub Daily&rsquo;, &lsquo;Sub Daily and Daily&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sub Daily, Daily and Monthly&rsquo; will be visible in the Allocation Network navigator. The user is not allowed to run allocation jobs if the range between &lsquo;From Date&rsquo; and &lsquo;To Date&rsquo; exceeds 31 days.</p>

    <p>User is allowed to run allocation when a month is locked. This could be configured in System Attribute =>ALLOW_ALLOC_LOCK_MONTH.</p>

    <p>There are also Logging level-popup to choose log level and Simulate-checkbox. Log Level is default to &lsquo;No Details&rsquo;. If the Simulate-checkbox is checked, the Run Calculations-button performs a simulated allocation; if no check mark it results in a normal allocation. The allocation is run in the background, it is an asynchronous job, and thus it is necessary to refresh the screen to see the new run as a row in screen when the allocation is finished.</p>

    <p>Typically this BF can be used for the Hourly Allocation and the Restricted Capacity Calculation.</p>

    <p>When a successful monthly, daily or sub daily run has been approved, the approved sub daily allocation can be re-run again on the approved network or any of its sub-network if the system property flag &ldquo;Allow re-running of Approved calculation&rdquo; in Maintain System Settings is set to &lsquo;Y&rsquo;. The default production day offset time will be used to add to the [From/To] dates to run the Sub Daily Allocation process, this will be validated against the any approved monthly, d<p>For instance, approved month was done to May 2005, an attempt to run a sub daily allocation with default production day offset time is -03:00, From Date and To Date parameters are 2005-04-30 21:00, 2005-04-30 22:00 respectively, it will be rejected by the system as this 2005-04-30 21:00 hour is considered within the month of May 2005.</p>

    <p>However, using 2005-04-30 20:00 and 2005-04-30 21:00 as [From/To] dates to run the sub daily allocation will be accepted, as 20:00 would not considered as within the approved May 2005 Month, and 21:00 is not inclusive in the process.</p>

    <p>It is possible to save comments on the run, both the successful and the failed runs. It is possible to delete a row holding the status of a particular allocation run.</p>
