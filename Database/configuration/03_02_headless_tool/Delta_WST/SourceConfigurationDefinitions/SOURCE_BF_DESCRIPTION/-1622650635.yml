  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is the daily registration BF which is used to enter either injected volume, injected ppm or on time for injection. Based on the configuration in CO.0212 - Chemical Injection Point BF, Energy Components (EC) will calculate injected volume and injection concentration (ppm).</p>

    <p>EC also automatically creates new rows for all predefined chemical injection points for a new production day. Thus, this BF has value instantiation for day start where blank lines for all chemical measured points will be inserted.</p>
