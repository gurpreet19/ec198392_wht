  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Transaction Properties screen</strong>    defines and
    manages all Transaction Templates for each Document Setup in a Contract. Each
    Document Setup must have at least one Transaction Template    defined, but may
    have a number of Transaction Templates defined. When processing the Contract,
    Documents are created containing Transactions based on the    Transaction Templates
    defined by the Contract / Document Setup.</p><p>    The key information defined
    for each Transaction Template is the Product, Price Concept and Profit Center.
    In addition there are several other attributes    defined for each Transaction
    Template.</p><p>    The transaction name will be determined by transaction template
    name being defined in this screen. The template name may contain static texts
    as well as    placeholders which will be replaced with the real values on transaction.
    A placeholder starts with "$". For example, template name "Journal Entry Posting
    -    $PRICE_OBJECT_NAME" might become "Journal Entry Posting - Normal" on new
    transactions.</p><p>    Supported placeholders are:<br>    - $PRODUCT_NAME: Product
    name<br>    - $PRICE_OBJECT_NAME: Price object name<br>    - $DELIVERY_POINT_NAME:
    Delivery point name<br>    - $PRICE_CONCEPT: Price<br>    - $RGE_PORT_NAME: Discharge
    port name<br>    - $QTY_TYPE: Quantity type</p><p>    The origin country will
    be determined by Loading Port on a Cargo based Contract, and by Delivery Point
    on a Period based Contract. The destination country    will be determined by discharge
    port on a cargo based contract, and by delivery point on a period based contract.
    This logic can be overwritten by using    the user exists ue_cont_transaction.GetOriginCountryForTrans
    and ue_cont_transaction.GetDestinationCountryForTrans.</p><p>    The screen is
    divided into following sections:<br>        <strong><em>Filter Navigator:</em></strong><br>    The
    Filter Navigator lists all the contracts being valid at the date selected in the
    Filter Navigator. By clicking a contract object in the Filter    Navigator all
    the documents defined for the contract will be listed in the Document List section.<br>        <strong><em>Document
    List:</em></strong><br>    The Document List lists all the documents defined for
    the selected contract. By clicking a Document the Transaction Templates for the
    selected Document    will be listed in the Transaction Template List.<br>       <strong><em>
