  DESCRIPTION: <p>This BF handles planned maintenance events for contracts. The screen is typically used for maintenance days, where the capacity is planned to be lower than usual.&nbsp;The user selects the contract and the date for the planned event in the navigator, and uses the insert button to create new entries. The Adjusted DCQ number&nbsp;should not be larger than the DCQ on the contract. When an adjusted DCQ has been registered, this will override the DCQ on the contract for that day.</p>
