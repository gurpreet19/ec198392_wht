  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to enter and display values for the monthly price indices. This business function allows the user to select a period and an index from a&nbsp;list of those available. The associated index value may then be entered. Data in this business function will be instantiated, so at the end of a month, a new (empty)&nbsp;row will be created in this business function for the next month, but it is still possible for the user to create new rows as required (using the button). The data&nbsp;presented in this business function is (up to) 12 rows for the year selected in the navigator. The rows are displayed in chronological order i.e. oldest first.</p>
