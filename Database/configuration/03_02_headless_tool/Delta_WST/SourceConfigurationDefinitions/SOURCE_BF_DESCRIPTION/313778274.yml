  DESCRIPTION: <p>The Monthly Forecast business function is a screen for entering/viewing forecasted gas deliveries for a given contract / delivery point. Forecast delivery information&nbsp;will be listed for selected months, and contracts and delivery points satisfying the navigator selection.</p><p>When selecting one month, daily values for this month will be listed, if available. The data in section 2 of the screen are the same as those found in Daily Gas Sales&nbsp;Forecast (SD.0001) and same rules apply. The data in this section are displayed in ascending order - e.g. the first day of the month is displayed at the top.&nbsp;The DCQ might be an adjusted value applied in the screen &ndash; Planned Delivery Restrictions.</p><p>Data will be stored (independently) at both monthly and daily (if available) level. This means that when the daily values are changed, the monthly Forecast Qty is not&nbsp;updated (but the Aggregated Forecast Qty will reflect the update). Similarly, updates at monthly level will not influence the daily values.</p>
