  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Cost of Service screen</strong>    is used to handle
    depreciation of capital expenses as well as operational costs based on criteria
    specified on objects implementing the Cost Asset    interface. E.g. [IN.0023 -
    Transactional Inventory Properties]. The values found in this screen will be influenced
    by Data Extract documents as defined and    ran in Data Extract Setup List screen
    (BF SP.0045) and Project Data Extract screen (BF SP.0046).</p><p>    - The screen
    contains a monthly and a yearly section and the numbers are stored individually
    at each level i.e. the yearly values are not aggregated from    the monthly ones.
    Below the value sections there is a form where you can add month/year or recalculate
    existing ones. The year can exist without any months    present however for a
    given month its year will be created if it does not exist.</p><p>    - Two methods
    are used: depreciation and operating. Based on the amount of capital added during
    the year and threshold factor, the method is chosen.    Operation Method: When
    the total additions for the year has not reached the threshold factor (either
    the January opening balance or the first balance value    in the year, times the
    system attribute COST_ADDITION_PERCENTAGE which has a default value of 10%). This
    method will have the running capital cost constant    and the Monthly Operation
    charge will include the additions for the month.</p><p>    - <strong>Depreciation
    Method</strong>: When the additions have reached the threshold during the year
    then the additions will be added to the Depreciation    Running Capital Cost in
    January of the following year. (The additions will not be part of the operating
    charges or the current year depreciation).</p><p>    - <strong>Operation Method</strong>:
    It will occur during the year that the Operating Method will be used up until
    the month that the threshold is reach.    In this situation then prior months
    will have a recommended action of Update, indicating that the month should be
    recalculated without the additions in the    operating cost. In these situations
    adjustments should be done for any reports that used the prior value (such as
    the MRC Report).</p>'
