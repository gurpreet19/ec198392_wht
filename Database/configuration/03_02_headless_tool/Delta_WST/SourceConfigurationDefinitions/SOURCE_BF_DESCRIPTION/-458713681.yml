  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Revenue Contract Attributes screen</strong>    is used
    to change the contract attributes.<br>    Each contract has a Contract Template
    (CO.2020) where the attributes are    defined. Depending on the template, different
    attributes can therefore be    listed in this screen.</p><p>    <u>The screen
    is divided into these sections:</u></p><p>    <strong><em>- Filter Navigator:</em></strong>    where
    a Contract is selected.</p><p>    <strong><em>- Attributes Section: </em></strong>    where
    all the attributes and current values for the selected Contract are    listed.</p><p>    <strong><em>-
    Attribute Version Section: </em></strong>    where all versions of the selected
    attribute in the previous section are    listed.<br>    If the attribute is retrieved
    from a user exit function this section will    be empty because there are no versions
    of the attribute.</p><p>    More information can be found at Transport Contract
    Attributes screen (BF    CO.2021).</p>'
