    used to start jobs that Verify or Approve daily data sets.</p><p style="font-weight:
    normal;">    The jobs (process IDs) are configured in a hierarchal structure:<br>    -
    Running a parent job runs all tasks defined for that job plus child jobs and their
    tasks.<br>    - Parameters from the parent job are passed to the child jobs, replacing
    their default parameter list.</p><h3 style="font-weight: normal;">    <strong

    to run a process.</p><p style="font-weight: normal;">    The list shows current
    status of monthly data set, when it was last executed, how many rows were updated
    and who ran the process. If a parent job is run,    the report will also list
    child jobs.<br>    Jobs should be configured so that they cover all data a role
    within the system is responsible for.</p><p style="font-weight: normal;">    This
    BF will only list processes having the interval set to the chosen Date.</p>'
