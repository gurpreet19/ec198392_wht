  DESCRIPTION: <p>This Business Function is used to identify the price objects that belong to a given price group. A price object can belong to any number of price groups and a price group can have any number of price object members. A price object&#39;s group membership is date effective. I.e the association between a given price object and a given price group has a start and an end date. The end date is optional.</p><p>The price group is identified using the navigator popup. Price objects can be added and removed using the toolbar Insert and Delete icons. The Delete icon removes the selected price object from the current price group; it does not delete the object itself.</p><p>The Price Calculations screen requires a Price Group as input. Price Calculations will process all price objects that belong to the selected price group on the calculation date.</p>
