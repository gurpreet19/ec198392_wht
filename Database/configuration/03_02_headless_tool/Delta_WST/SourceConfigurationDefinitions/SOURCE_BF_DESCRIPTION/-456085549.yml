  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used by the transport service provider to view and manually enter operational nominations into the system.</p><p>Operational nominations are special nominations that only the transport service operator is allowed to enter into the system. These nominations can, depending on&nbsp;project implementation, adhere to different validation rules than normal nominations. Since operational nominations can only be entered by the transport service&nbsp;operator, they are per definition accepted by the operator. The initial nomination status will therefore always be &lsquo;Accepted&rsquo;.</p><p>An example of an operational nomination will be imbalance payback from and to the pipeline. Imbalance nominations are used to adjust the gas flow according to&nbsp;the agreed Operational Balancing Agreement (OBA) between interconnected pipelines and the transport service provider.</p>
