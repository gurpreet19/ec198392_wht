  DESCRIPTION: <p>Any unplanned delay or abort of the lifting operation must be recorded as a delay. Delays are events which are not already covered in the cargo activity time sheet.&nbsp;Typical examples for delays are weather conditions, oil-spill, etc. The delay period (from/to), type of delay (delay code) and originator is recorded. Elapsed time is&nbsp;calculated based on delay period. Originator indicates who is responsible for the delay, and may be used in further demurrage calculations.</p><p>This screen will look similar to the Terminal Operation Delays except for the records displayed in the data section will be filtered only for unloading delays.</p>
