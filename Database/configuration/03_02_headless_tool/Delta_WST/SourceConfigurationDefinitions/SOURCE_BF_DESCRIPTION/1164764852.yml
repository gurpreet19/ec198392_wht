  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p>This Business Function is part of the Business Process to enter component analysis results for profit centre streams.</p>

    <p>A new analysis will be created when clicking on the insert button in the toolbar and saving the record after the mandatory values have been specified. When saving the analysis, the belonging component set is automatically created. The component set being used is a pre-configured set of hydrocarbon components, which is specified in the configuration screen for the hydrocarbon component set. The records can be filtered by providing the navigator values for Group Model, Analysis Status and Sampling Method. Group Model navigator values are mandatory while navigator values for Analysis Status and Sampling Method are optional. Analysis data will be filtered based on Valid From date. If this value is null, data will be filtered according to the production day of the analysis Daytime.</p>

    <p>The &lsquo;Mol &lt;-&gt; Wt&rsquo; button will calculate either weight or mole percent for each component if one of them is missing. When pressing this button this calculation will be conducted on db level, meaning it uses the values that are stored in the database. The calculation factors (mol weight) that are being used are fetched from a database table containing time dependant constants on each of the hydrocarbon components. A configuration interface for the conversion factors exists as a part of the configuration screens (Component Constant screen). However, the conversion factor for the heaviest component is always the Cn+ constant from the analysis. This implies that the component set must <em>always </em>contain a heavy component (e.g. C5+) where this component <em>must not </em>have a mol weight specified.</p>

    <p>The &lsquo;Normalize&rsquo; button will scale all component numbers with the same factor</p>

    <p><em> x = 100% / &sum;<sub>&forall;component</sub> component_percentage </em></p>

    <p>For both weight and mol percentages to have the sum add up to 100%.</p>

    <p>If a stream is not assigned to a specified constant standard, ISO6976 which is a default standard (configured in System Attribute screen) will be used in calculation.</p>

    <p>It is very important for users to ensure that components and mol wt are specified for the constant standard (in Component Constant screen) including for ISO6976. Conversion calculation will only work if components and mol wt are defined.
