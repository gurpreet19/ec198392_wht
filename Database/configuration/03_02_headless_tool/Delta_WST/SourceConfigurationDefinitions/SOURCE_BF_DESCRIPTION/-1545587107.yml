  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The navigator and comments areas have the same functionality as
    in the liquids quantities screen. Please note that the comments are common to
    the forecast case. This means that changing a comment here will also change the
    comments for the liquids quantities screen.</p><p>The table below the navigator
    shows the annual average prices in pricing currency and local currency by field.
    The Base Price and Differential columns for a given field will be empty unless
    both the Base Price and Differential are known for all months for that field.
    The local currency is a system attribute, which may be overridden on the company,
    i.e. TEPN. Therefore this currency is not for the user that configures the forecast
    cases to select, but rather looked up from the configuration.</p><p>The month-by-month
    table shows the prices by field and month. At the bottom of this table there is
    a row showing the average price throughout the year. All input will be done through
    this table.</p><p>All parts of the forecast case will be populated when the Populate
    Forecast Case on the Properties screen is pressed. The prices part of this logic
    will work as follows:<br>�&nbsp;If the Populate Method is PLAN, then all columns
    except the Forex column will initially be empty. The Base Price will be fetched
    from the selected general price object if such an object is chosen for the current
    forecast case. The user may override the Base Price if necessary. If no such general
    price object is selected the user must enter the price manually. The Differential
    must be entered manually. The Net Price will be the sum of the Base Price and
    the Differential. The Forex column will be populated with rates from the standard
    currency exchange table using standard Sales and Purchases lookup logic. The user
    can override these rates by entering a new one. The Local Price will be the Net
    Price converted to local currency using the Forex just entered.<br>�&nbsp;For
    the months after the month of the Forecast Case, the Base Price in pricing currency
    will be copied from the connected general price object. If no such object is connected
    they will be copied from the official forecast case for the previous month. The
    Differential will be copied from the official forecast case for the previous month.
    The Forex will be looked up from the currency exchange table and NOT copied from
    the previous month�s forecast case. The price in local currency will this way
    be calculated for the PLAN months using the new Forex. The user may change the
    unit price in pricing currency and the Forex if necessary.<br>�&nbsp;For the months
    up to and including the month of the Forecast Case object, actual numbers will
    be copied into forecast case. When an invoice is created, the Base Price and Differential
    are summed to creating only one line item on the invoice. This line item uses
    the Net Price. For this reason, the information of the Base Price and Differential
    is not known for the actual data. The Net Price will be the ratio between all
    non-adjusted revenue for the field and month in question and the actual sales
    quantity for the field and month in question. This lookup is done by finding the
    line items selling from the field in question belonging to transactions with point
    of sale date within the month in question. The documents that these transactions
    belong to must be set to BOOKED. The Local Price is calculated the same way. The
    Forex is calculated as the ratio between Local Price and Net Price.<br>�&nbsp;In
    the screenshot above the forecast case�s month is May, and therefore the June
    thru December months are editable.</p><p><br>Populate method = PLAN</p><p>�&nbsp;Base
    Price � The product has a general price: The monthly valid general price is fetched
    from price values tables for the product in question. The column is editable.<br>�&nbsp;Base
    Price � The product does not have a general price: The column is initially empty
    and editable.When base prices are entered manually, then these values should be
    preserved when re-populating. <br>�&nbsp;Differential: Initially empty and editable.<br>�&nbsp;Net
    Price: Net Price = Base Price + Differential. Calculated on the fly. Not editable<br>�&nbsp;Forex:
    The MONTH exchange rate for the Pricing Currency and the Local Currency in question.
    Column is editable.<br>�&nbsp;Local Price: Local Price = Net Price * Forex. Not
    editable.</p><p>Populate method = YEAR TO MONTH</p><p>�&nbsp;Base Price: The Base
    Price prior to Plan Date = NULL and not editable. The Base Price is editable after
    the Plan Date.<br>�&nbsp;Differential: The Differential prior to Plan Date = NULL
    and not editable. The Differential is editable after the Plan Date.<br>�&nbsp;Net
    Price: The Net Price prior to Plan Date = Local Price / Forex. The net price after
    the Plan Date = Base Price + Differential. Not editable<br>�&nbsp;Forex: The MONTH
    exchange rate for the Pricing Currency and the Local Currency in question. Column
    is editable.<br>�&nbsp;Local Price: The Local Price prior to the Plan Date is
    the sum of the actual sales (monetary values on the contract documents) for the
    Product, Company and Field in question. Only documents which are booked and where
    the transaction date is prior to the Plan Date are considered. This sum divided
    by the Sales Qty (ref. Sales Qty column above) gives us the local price. The Local
    Price after the Plan Date = Net Price * Forex. Not editable.<br></p>'
