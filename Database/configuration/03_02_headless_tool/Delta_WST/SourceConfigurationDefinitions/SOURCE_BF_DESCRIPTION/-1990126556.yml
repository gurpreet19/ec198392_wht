  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The XSD Downloads screen allows users to generate and download
    XML Schema Design (XSD) files for EC classes. This can either be done for single
    classes selected by the user, or for all the classes in EC.</p><p>The XSD functionality
    is used exclusively together with the EC Web Services.</p><p>XSDs are used to
    describe the structure of the XML documents returned from the GetClassData web
    service function. Since each class has a different structure, the documents generated
    by this function will vary depending on the class queried. Therefore, there is
    one XSD document corresponding to each class. As a convenience, all of the XSDs
    (one for each class) can be downloaded as a single zip file.</p><p>The XSDs can
    be used in the Web Service client either for validating data or for code generation
    of client data structures. Users may also utilize XSDs within other XML technologies,
    such as Web Services Description Language (WSDL) files, for further creation and
    implementation of web services.</p><p>Note that since EC classes are dynamic and
    changeable by configuration, any generated XSD code would need to be updated (i.e.
    regenerated) whenever a class is changed.</p><p>The navigator at the top of the
    screen consists of a dropdown for supported class types (e.g. DATA, OBJECT, etc),
    and another one for the corresponding classes. Below this navigator are two buttons:
    ‘Get Class XSD’ is used to generate and download a single XSD for the selected
    class; ‘Get All XSDs in Zip Format’ generates XSDs for all EC classes, and zips
    them into a downloadable file.</p><p>If either one of the above buttons is clicked,
    a download window appears, allowing the user to select the target location of
    the download. The name of the download file will either be the name of the selected
    class (e.g. WELL.xsd), or ‘EcXSDs.zip’, which should include XSDs for all classes.</p><p>The
    ‘Get Class XSD’ button requires a class to be selected in the navigator. An error
    appears if the Class Name field is empty.</p>'
