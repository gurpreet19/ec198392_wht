  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to display and record/maintain details of Profit Centre / Field export, fuel, flare, etc. When the user selects the required parameters in&nbsp;the navigator and clicks the &ldquo;Go&hellip;&rdquo; button the &ldquo;Field List&rdquo; component is populated accordingly. This component utilizes the CO.3018 &ndash; Maintain Stream Mapping&nbsp;concept in order to configure the columns and populate the content (rows).</p><p>By default the &ldquo;Field List&rdquo; component shows aggregated daily details of predicted export, fuel consumed per field. On D-1 these values are typically taken from the&nbsp;forecasting system. Initially, the &ldquo;Fuel Supplied&rdquo; and &ldquo;Export After Fuel&rdquo; will be blank. Each field has a single defined unit, which applies to all values for that field&nbsp;within this business function.</p><p>In the &ldquo;Hourly Details&rdquo; selector there are only two options; &ldquo;Predicted Export&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fuel Consumed&rdquo; and based on the selected item the sub daily / hourly table lists&nbsp;all the hours within the selected day in the navigator.</p><p>For this business function on day D, the export values are read from PI as appropriate. These values are read hourly, and the end-of-day prediction is extrapolated&nbsp;from the hourly values. Using the &ldquo;Hourly Data&rdquo; component, it is possible for the user to make alterations to the hourly values for export and fuel to define a more&nbsp;accurate estimate of export profile that that calculated by the extrapolation. For each field, the sum of the hourly values is displayed as the daily export in the main&nbsp;stream for that stream.</p><p>The &ldquo;corrected daily hour-rate&rdquo; field with it&rsquo;s accompanied &ldquo;Apportion&rdquo; button is used to set values into the hourly table for the Estimated column.</p><p>Blank hourly (and one daily) rows are pre-instantiated on this screen in advance (for example rows for day D are written on day D-1). The instantiation process will&nbsp;take care of 23 and 25 hour days where daylight saving time is in use.</p>
