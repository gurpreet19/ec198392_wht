  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to run the price calculations pr Price Object. This is basically the same as Price Calculation (PR.0008), but with a main difference.&nbsp;<span style=""line-height:1.6"">Instead of running the same calculation for selected price objects, this BF will look up what calculation to run for the individual price objects.</span></p><p>On the Price Object there is an attribute &lsquo;Price Calculation&rsquo; that will hold the information about what calculation should be run for this price object. If this value is&nbsp;empty the price object is ignored. If the calculation fails for one price object the rest of the calculations will not be executed.</p><p>The order on how the price objects are run when part of Price Groups is defined by the &lsquo;Calculation Sequence&rsquo; attribute on Price Object.<br />Note that the calculation period selected on Price Group that will be used are Period argument into the calculation engine.</p>
