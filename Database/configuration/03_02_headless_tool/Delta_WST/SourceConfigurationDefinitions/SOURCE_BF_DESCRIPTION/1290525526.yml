  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p> This business function is used to capture Shortfall Factors for a Scenario. A shortfall factor (or service factor) is a statistical factor used to estimate unknown events.These factors are then applied to the forecasted production/injection numbers. Each scenario can have many such factors, both for different phases and also for different reasons. </p>

    <p>  This business function has two independent data sections. The first data section is used to enter shortfall factors for any group model levels above well and equal to or below the Forecast group model level. Shortfall factors is entered for a date and the last available shortfall factor is the one being used until a new shortfall factor is entered.


    <p> The second data section provides capability of capturing override factors on a well level. For these entries, a valid from and valid to date must be entered, and there has to be a value for each of the factors for where an override is required.</p>

    <p> For each phase, we have the following factors:
           - S1P (Shortfall Planned - corresponds to events such as maintenance, inspection or development operations.)
           - S1U (Shortfall Unplanned - corresponds to events such as technical/ human error or disruptions in the production system.)
           - S2 (Non-operational Shortfall - corresponds to events unrelated to operations, such as strikes and extreme weather.) </p>

    <p> The business functions support the following phases:
          - Oil
          - Gas
          - Condensate
          - Gas Lift
          - Diluent
          - Water Injection
          - Gas injection
          - Steam injection
          - CO2 injection </p>
