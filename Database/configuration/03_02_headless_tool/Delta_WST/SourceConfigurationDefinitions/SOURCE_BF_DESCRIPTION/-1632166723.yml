  DESCRIPTION: "<p>\t<b>    Project Data Mapping Setup screen</b> allows to create\
    \ mapping objects that will be used when executing the Data Mapping for a given\
    \ Dataset in the Project    Data Mapping screen (BF SP.0041).<br>\t\t<strong style=\"\
    font-weight: normal;\"> - The screen supports</strong>    insert, delete, and\
    \ update of mapping objects. The Data Mapping objects are using standard EC date-effective\
    \ versions.<br>\t\t\t<strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">- The attribute section</strong>\
    \    defines the object itself in addition to the target mapping that applies\
    \ to this object, i.e. different settings that will identify the target records.<br>\
    \    - In addition to the standard EC object screen, this business function has\
    \ a <strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">child section</strong> where all the\
    \ Source Mapping is defined.</p><p>\t\t\t\t<strong>Button <span style=\"color:\
    \ rgb(0, 153, 0);\">Report Reference Group</span>\t\t\t\t\t<br>\t\t\t\t\t</strong>-\
    \ This button appears if the selected Mapping entry is based an a Report Reference\
    \ Group<br>- By clicking the Report Reference Group button a separate popup-window\
    \ will be launched showing the setup of Report Reference Items which are connected\
    \ with the selected Report Reference Group.</p><p style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\
    >\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>The Source Mapping section</strong>    maps the particular\
    \ Data Mapping object towards Data entry records which meet the match criteria\
    \ defined here. The user might use individual/lists of    different objects or\
    \ codes in addition to comparison operators to suit its needs.</p><p style=\"\
    font-weight: normal;\">\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>The bottom section of the screen (below\
    \ the list of object attributes) is slightly different depending on the Data Entry\

    \t\t\t\t<strong>Data Entry Source = Class Data:</strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>    -\
    \ The bottom section shows the Class Mapping for the selected Data Mapping object.<br>\
    \    - The Data Filter attribute tells which Class Mapping is in use.<br>    -\
    \ The Setup button allows for editing/configuring the Data Filters. This button\
    \ will open a new popup window where each of the different Data Filters are  \
    \  listed together with their configuration.</p><p style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\

    \ configuration the user can access more detailed information through the buttons\
    \ at the bottom:</p><p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Button\
