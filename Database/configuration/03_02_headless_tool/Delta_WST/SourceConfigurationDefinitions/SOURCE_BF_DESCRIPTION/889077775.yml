  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This screen is used to connect equipment object to other assets. The screen opens to model one to many dependencies between an equipment to different asset classes. Examples: A compressors can link to a few wells or facilities.</p>

    <p>The connections have a start and end date, where end date is exclusive.</p>

    <p>The reason for adding this BF is that we want to make it possible to support a link between Equipment, Well, Facility or Well Hookup that is not related to the stream node diagram.</p>
