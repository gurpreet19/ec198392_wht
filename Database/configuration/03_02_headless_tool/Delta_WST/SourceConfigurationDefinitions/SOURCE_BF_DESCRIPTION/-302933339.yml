  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>Allocation Network List is used to connect allocation nodes to an allocation network. The Allocation Network List screen enables the user to add, delete and edit nodes connected in a given allocation network. The allocation network is selected using the navigator.</p>

    <p>When running allocation all nodes associated to a given network will be processed. Therefore before it is possible to run an allocation, nodes must be linked to a specific network using this configuration screen. It should be noted that a node may belong to several allocation networks.</p>

    <p>Wells are included implicit to the allocation network and will therefore not be selectable in the allocation network name navigator. Streams are also implicit included in the alloction network through nodes (streams flow to and/or from a node).</p>
