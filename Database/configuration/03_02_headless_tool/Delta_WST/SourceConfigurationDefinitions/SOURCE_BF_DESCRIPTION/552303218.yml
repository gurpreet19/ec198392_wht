  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p>The &quot;Date&quot; filter is only used to filter group model. Forecast 1 is selected using &quot;Forecast 1 Date&quot; and &quot;Forecast 1 Type&quot; dropdowns. Similarly, Forecast 2 is selected using &quot;Forecast 2 Date&quot; and &quot;Forecast 2 Type&quot; dropdowns. Both Forecast dropdowns are sorted in the descending order of daytime.</p>
     <p>Forecast scenarios are compared for same months unless Scenario 2 Offset [months] is provided. Offset values can be positive or negative When Scenario Offset is set to &quot;3&quot; then Monthly average value of 2011-01 in Scenario 1 is compared to Monthly average value of 2011-04 in Scenario 2. Similarly, when Scenario Offset is set to &quot;-2&quot; then Monthly average value of 2011-03 in Scenario 1 is compared to Monthly average value of 2011-01 in Scenario 2.</p><p>This business function consists of four tabs as follows:</p>

    FROM_MONTH and TO_MONTH must be compared with &quot;=&quot; sign, because there is a GROUP BY in the view. This is not an issue on the screen.</p>
