  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p>This business function is used to capture Production Well Potentials for a Scenario. </p>

    <p>The business function supports the following phases: - Oil - Gas - Condensate - Water.</p>

    <p> The following potential values are available for each production phases daily: </p>
    <p> - Base potential : Field potential excluding well interventions.</p>
    <p> - Well intervention potential: Potential of the interventions planned on existing wells for the budgeted year.  E.g. work overs, re-perforations in the current pay zone, acid treatment campaign, water or gas shut-off etc.</p>
    <p> - New well potential : Potential of the new wells planned for the budgeted year.  E.g. new drilling operations, sidetracks, drilling of a new zone in an existing well etc.</p>
    <p> - New project potential: Potential of the new projects planned for the budgeted year/forecast period. E.g. new field developments (including wells), well re-engineering, debottlenecking etc. </p>

    <p>The Unconstrained potential is the sum of all the potentials mentioned above (Base + Well intervention + New Wells + New Projects).</p>

    <p>The potential values are entered for a date, and the last available potential values for a Well will be valid until new values are entered. </p>
