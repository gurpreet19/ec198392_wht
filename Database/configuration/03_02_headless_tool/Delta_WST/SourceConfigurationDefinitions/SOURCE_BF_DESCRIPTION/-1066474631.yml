  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Document Text Setup screen</strong> is used to define textual
    objects to be used when processing the Contract. The text objects defined here
    are copied to the Document when processing. The information is copied and not
    referenced because the user can add and delete text at the Document level when
    processing.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Navigator</strong></p><p>The
    Navigator lists all the contracts being valid at the date selected in the Navigator.
    By clicking a contract object in the Navigator all the documents defined for the
    contract will be listed in the Document List section.</p><p><strong style="color:
    rgb(0, 102, 204);">Document List Section</strong></p><p>    The section lists
    all the documents defined for the selected contract. By clicking a Document the
    Document Text objects for the selected Document will be listed.</p><p><strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Header Section, Multi Column:</strong><br>    The
    text objects defined will be part of the header section of the document. In this
    section the user can add text objects that are divided into three columns. </p><p><strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Header Section, Single Column:</strong><br>    These
    text objects will also be part of the header section of the document. The text
    will be in one single column and left aligned.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0,
    102, 204);">Footer Section, Multi Column:</strong><br>    The text objects defined
    will be part of the footer section of the document. In this section the user can
    add text objects that are divided into three columns.</p><p><strong style="color:
    rgb(0, 102, 204);">Footer Section, Single Column:</strong><br>    These text objects
    will also be part of the footer section of the document. The text will be in one
    single column and left aligned.</p><p>    Within the header section text objects
    there is sort order support. The header section multi column text objects are
    sorted together with the header section single column text objects. The same concept
    applies for the footer text objects as well.</p><p>    The user can add and delete
    text objects from all of the four sections. Text objects can be left blank, either
    to be filled in during document processing or to stay blank even after document
    processing. Each text object will have a sort number.</p><p>There is no limit
    to the number of characters in each column, but <strong>NOTE</strong>, if there
    are too many characters in a column, the text might flow into the next column
    or wrap when printed on the document hardcopy.</p>'
