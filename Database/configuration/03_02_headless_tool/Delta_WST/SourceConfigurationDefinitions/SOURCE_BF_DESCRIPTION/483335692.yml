  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screen in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>

    <p>The Production Day screen is used to create production day objects. The production day objects can be linked to several classes that need to calculate the production day in different ways. The product will always have one default production day object that will be used when the class does not have a relation to another production day object.</p>

    <p>This concept is introduced in EC Release 9.0, and replaces the production day offset that previously was configured on Facility, Contract or as a system attribute.</p>

    <p>Object classes can now have direct links to Production day objects, defined as relations between the object class and a production day object. Note however that there are business assumptions in some case (i.e. Deferment) that the production day connection is done on a higher level typically Facility.</p>

    <p>There is business logic in the package layer in packages EcDp_ProductionDay and EcDp_ContractDay that will find production day links on parent level or use the default Production day object if no relation can be found.</p>

    <p>Before the enhancement to support multiple time zones in Production Day screen, EC will only support one timezone for each database schema. There is however a need for some objects related to production day, to operate with different time zones in record timestamping (daytime), and different daylight saving rules. Thus the enhancement to support the multiple time zones is introduced. These related objects are Well, Stream, Tank, Flowline, Production Seperator, Facility Class 1, Facility Class 2, Contract and Meter.</p>

    <p>The Production Day screen is enhanced with a new field called [Time Zone Region], which is a non mandatory field that allows user to specify the time zone which is being configured at the EC codes screen above. Thus, for those who do not need multiple time zones support, simply use the Production Day configuration without any time zone region.</p>

    <p>There are 3 methods of configuring the production day as following.</p>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>The production day with a specific time zone region and this region has daylight saving time. It uses the multiple time zone supports.</li>
    <li>The production day with a specific time zone region and this region has no daylight saving time. It uses the multiple time zone supports.</li>
    <li>The production day without a time zone. It did not use the multiple time zone supports and remain the use of old method to refer to the system attribute for UTC2LOCAL_DIFF and UTC2LOCALDEFAULT.</li>
    </ul>
