  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen is used to maintain forecasting Input Delivery Point as export values from delivery point. Ordinarily, these values would be loaded into the system via&nbsp;messages, typically from a coordinator who collect forecast values from the production units. However this screen may be used to view, edit, delete or add values.&nbsp;Existing values can be modified and new values for new events (dates) can be added. The values are stored per Delivery Point. Depending on which combination of&nbsp;those is selected in the navigator, different sets of data will be shown in the data section.</p><p>The user selects a date range, Business Unit and [or Delivery Point] and Forecast and Series, from the navigator at the top of the screen and presses the &ldquo;Go&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;button. The planning period details are then populated in the Forecast Input Delivery Point [FCST_DP_DAY_STATUS] table. It is now possible to add, edit or delete&nbsp;values for individual planning periods in the Forecast Input Delivery Point table</p>
