  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to maintain input and output nominations as a cross-tab. The order of the nomination-columns is dictated by globally looking up the&nbsp;sort order of the Nomination Point definitions.</p><p>This business function is basically the same as other daily nomination business functions, but it presents the data differently. The user will see the data over a&nbsp;selected period. Each nomination point for selected navigation object will be listed across. Only one quantity can be entered for the combination of date and&nbsp;nomination point. If more quantities required use the Daily Input Nomination / Daily Output Nomination.</p><p>For more information about the nomination process pls. See Daily Input Nomination / Daily Input Nomination.</p>
