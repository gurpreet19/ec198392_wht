  DESCRIPTION: '<h2>Introduction</h2><p>The Report Administration screen provides
    the following functionality:</p><ul><li>Create report (instances of a report defintion
    that can be generated)</li><li>Configure distribution of reports</li><li>Generate
    reports</li><li>View/download, send and publish generated reports</li><li>Search
    for generated reports based on report parameter values</li><li>Send (using messaging
    system)</li></ul><p>In the navigator for the screen, a date and optionally a functional
    area must be selected. A list with reports for the selected functional area will
    show up. The list of reports will be filtered based on access check indicators
    on report parameters. Further filtering of reports can be done using the table
    filters.&nbsp;</p><p>A <em>report</em> (sometimes called report runable) is an
    instance of a report definition. Only report parameters without a value from the
    report definition can be populated for the report. Parameters with a value in
    report definition will not be visible here. When adding, updating or deleting
    a parameter in a report template, this will affect parameters in reports that
    are linked to the report template (through the report definition).</p><p>If the
    automatic flag for a report is checked, it will be included when scheduling a
    report definition in the Schedules configuration screen.</p><p>Under the list
    of reports there are three tabs:</p><ul><li>Generate: Set parameter values for
    the report and generate report.</li><li>Search: Search generated reports based
    on report parameters.</li><li>Distribution: Configure distribution of report.</li></ul><h2>Generate
    Tab</h2><h3>Generate report</h3><p>A report is generated by populating the report
    parameters, and clicking the Generate button. The following steps will then be
    executed:</p><ol><li>Check if the report has a parameters defined as Report Date
    Parameter (defined in RP.0002 Report Definition screen). If the parameter exists
    with a valid value, the value is then checked against the currently selected version
    (based on navigator date). If it’s not within the selected version, an error message
    will be displayed and report generating is discontinued.</li><li>A new row shows
    up in the Generated Reports section, with status NEW. The rest of the generation
    process is done in a scheduled task called ReportEngine. The user will need to
    click on ''Refresh'' to get updates on the status.</li><li>The scheduled job generates
    the report items based on the defined report templates. The report parameter values
    given for the report definition will be used. For report parameters that have
    no value for the report definition, the value given for the report in this screen
    will be used. If no parameter value is found for a parameter, the value will be
    the string&nbsp;<em>null</em>.</li><li>If some report items have the format ''pdf''
    and the archive-flag for the report definition is not checked, the pdfs will be
    merged together using the order given by the report template. If the archive-flag
    is checked, the pdfs will be included in a zip-file. For all other formats, the
    report items will be separate files included in a zip-file.</li><li>If the report
    is generated successfully, the report file (either a file in a specific format,
    or a zip-file) is stored to the database and the generation status is set to GENERATED.
    If something went wrong, the generation status is set to ERROR. The report status
    is set to <em>provisional.&nbsp;</em></li></ol><p>By clicking the popout icon
    next to the report status, a dialog box will show up, providing error messages
    and a button for download of detailed log (scheduler log).</p><p>The list of generated
    reports will be filtered by the ''Generation Start - From/To'' dates at the bottom
    of the list. By default these dates will be from 1st of previous month to today.
    This filtering is necessary to prevent loading too much data. The list will also
    be filtered by access check on report parameters.&nbsp;</p><p>When selecting a
    generated report, Generated Report Parameters-, Send Log- and Publish Report sections
    will show values for this run.</p><h3>View</h3><p>When the view button is clicked,
    the generated report is downloaded. The user can then choose to open it in an
    appropriate application, or save it to disk.</p><p>By default, the file name suggested
    by the system will be the report name. However, the file name can be customized
    by implementing the user exit UE_REPORT.getAttachmentName( report_no ). This way
    you can include e.g. file name, generation date, parameter values, etc. to the
    suggested filename.</p><h3>Send</h3><p>To be able to send a report, it has to
    be linked to at least one distribution list. This is done in the Distribution
    tab. When the Send button is clicked, a dialog box will show up, listing the messages
    to be sent (based on configuration and report status). The report is sent by clicking
    the Send button in the dialog box. The Message Handling Management system (MHM)
    is then invoked. The report will be sent to all the recipients defined by the
    associated distribution lists.</p><p>When associating distribution lists with
    a report using the Message Distribution BF:</p><ol><li>The Message Distribution
    must have one and only one parameter.</li><li>This parameter must be named<em>
    "Report Name",</em> where type is <em>Basic Type</em> and sub type is <em>STRING</em>.</li><li>The
    value of this parameter must be the name of the report (from the Report section).</li><li>There
    are different distribution lists for different Report Statuses. A distribution
    list is assigned based on the Report Status.</li><li>The subject of the message
    is determined by the subject specified in the Message Type (Create Message Type
    and Maintain Message Type). Replacement of the subject string is done as:<ul><li
    class="ql-indent-1">$REPORT_NAME$ - This will be replaced by the report name.</li><li
    class="ql-indent-1">$PARAM_NAME$ - This will be replaced by the value of the parameter
    named</li></ul></li></ol><p>The <em>Send Log</em> tab will show all messages sent.</p><h3>Publish</h3><p>If
    Display Published Reports BF is used to give users access to a limited number
    of generated reports, the Publish Report tab will allow for publication period
    and other information to be entered. When inserting a new record in this section,
    Report Date and Access Check Parameters will be automatically populated based
    on report configuration. If required these can be edited by the user.</p><p>If
    any of the parameters has the "Check Access" flag activated and ring fencing is
    active, a user will only see the reports having report parameter values which
    the user has access to. The user will also be prevented from generating reports
    having parameter values excluding access. Access check will only be done for parameters
    that do not have the values preset on the report definitions.</p><h2>Search Tab</h2><p>To
    be able to find previously generated reports, the user can enter parameter values,
    generation date range, report period range, and then click on ''Go''. The Generated
    Report section will then show all generated reports matching the given criteria.</p><p>Note
    that only parameters configured as ''Basic Type'' and ''Object Type'' are currently
    supported.</p><p>All operations on generated reports will be the same as in the
    Generate tab.</p><h2>Distribution Tab</h2><p>Configuration of messages to send
    is done here. Message types and distribution lists need to be configured first
    (in other screens). Different message types and distribution lists can then be
    added here per report status.</p><p>When a message type and distribution lists
    are configured here, the system will add the parameters ''Report Name'' and ''Accept
    Status'' (same as report status) to the message type, and then add the distribution
    lists to this message type (see Message Distribution screen).</p><p>When the user
    chooses to send the report, the configured messages for the current report status
    will be used.</p>'
