  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This business function is used to search among tanks and chemical tanks. Further it can take you to Tank/Chemical Tank business functions.</p>

    <p>In the navigator, there is a free text field which is used as the search target string.</p>

    <p>By default, EC shipped with search criteria on Code and Name, user can search for the right tank objects where its Code and Name matched with the defined search target string.</p>

    <p>The search is not case sensitive in this context and no wildcards needed.</p>

    <p>In addition, EC also provides user with the flexibility to re-define the search criteria on other tank attributes, such as TANK_TYPE. Search criteria can be reduced to a single attribute or can be increased to more than one attribute, but it has to be delimited with a keyboard character &quot;|&quot;, which is the vertical bar (or DOS pipe character).</p>

    <p>The data section below will then list all tanks for the defined search criteria matched with (or like) the search target string.</p>

    <p>By choosing a tank or chemical tank, it will show you the active group models associated with the selected tank/chemical tank object. After you selected the active group model, the third column will populate the group model relations with the objects and its value.</p>

    <p>By selecting a related business function and pressing the &lsquo;Go to BF&rsquo; button, a new window will be opened with the navigator values pre-populated based on selected tank.</p>
