  DESCRIPTION: <p>Once the gas-day is completed, the exact delivery under each contract must be determined.</p><p>Actual delivered quantities at a given delivery point are determined by actual measurements at same point and any allocation procedure in the event that multiple&nbsp;suppliers (often referred to as &ldquo;shippers&rdquo;) are delivering gas through same meter. It is the task of the transport operator to determine actual quantities delivered at&nbsp;each delivery point.</p><p>In some cases, there is a one-to-one relationship between gas sales contract and delivery point, meaning that the metered gas quantity will equal the delivery&nbsp;under that contract. In other cases, the actual metered quantity will need to be split down to multiple sales contracts at the same delivery point (referred to as &ldquo;Sales&nbsp;Allocation&rdquo;).</p><p>The Daily Profit Centre Delivery business function is a screen for entering/viewing actual gas quantity deliveries for a profit centre of a given contract / delivery<br />point. After selecting the date, contract and delivery point, all deliveries for proft centre is listed</p>
