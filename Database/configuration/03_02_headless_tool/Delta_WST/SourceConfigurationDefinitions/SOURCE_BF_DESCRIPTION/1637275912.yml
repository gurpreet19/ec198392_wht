  DESCRIPTION: <p>Each lifter has a right to lift his share of the products at stock according to his entitlement normally defined in a so-called &quot;lifting procedure&quot;. The lifting procedure defines the process in which the lifter must duly inform the terminal operator about his plans/requests to lift, also referred to as &quot;nomination&quot;.</p><p>Nomination data hence must be recorded for each request, including the requested quantities, time period when to lift, the carrier to lift on and which product (storage) to lift. The lifting procedure defines the deadlines for making such nominations. Typically the next month lifting program must be settled in due time before the month start (often on the 15th in the preceding month), and hence nominations must be received prior to that (typically on the 10th of same month).</p><p>The scheduler then, upon receiving the nominations from all lifters, will prepare a schedule and plan the detailed lifting of each product in such manner that inventory levels are maintained above minimum and below maximum limits at any time, as well as resolving any conflicting situations (lifter want to lift at same period) according to each lifters entitlement (availability) to lift and any over/under-lifting constraints.</p><p>This BF is the screen for maintaining nominations entered manually. Manual entry of nominations for a month is based on official lifter availability for the same month. The lifters will request dates and quantities within the month, while the scheduler will have to balance the total requests within the month by controlling the nominated dates and quantities. The screen displays nominations by month.</p><p>Entered nominations are organized into cargoes by selecting nominations in the screen and then pressing the &lsquo;Generate Cargo&rsquo; button. The number series to be used for each Storage system can be configured for each customer implementation (it is possible to define a customer specific cargo numbering function). The cargo number is only generated the first time. If any of the conditions for the generated number are changed, the user must do it in the Cargo Information business function (CP.0003).</p><p>When a new nomination is inserted in the screen, it is not connected to a cargo. To do that, the user has two choices. <br />&mdash;&gt; Press the &lsquo;Generate Cargo&rsquo; button and a new cargo will be created and the selected parcel(s) will be connected to new cargo <br />&mdash;&gt; Select a cargo from the cargo popup and press the &lsquo;Generate Cargo&rsquo; button.</p><p>If any of these actions lead to an empty cargo, the cargo is removed from the system.</p><p>A new Cargo will get the cargo status set to Tentative. To read more about cargo statuses please read Cargo Status Rules.</p><p> It is possible to configure the cargo popup to only list the cargo number of the multiple selected nominations in the screen. To read more about this functionality please read Cargo Popup section in this document. </p><p>When a nomination is inserted/update an account transaction is inserted/updated. To read more about transactions please read Lifting Account Transaction Rules.</p><p>To support operations that use sub daily data there is a column for storing the Nominated date and time.</p>
