  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen is used to record information about a planned lifting. It contains basic information about the future lifting, including status. This information can normally be derived from the official cargo schedule for the terminal.</p><p>The intention is to record all information which shall be accounted prior to the actual lifting can be recorded. Therefore,&nbsp;information and reports generated during or after the lifting could refer to all relevant cargo information.</p><p>This screen is based on the principle that a cargo consists of one or more cargo parcels, with each parcel having a defined owner company(Consignor) and a primary buying party (Consignee). This approach is quite common for offshore equity liftings, which indeed is the prime purpose of CA.0001.</p><p>A group lifting occurs when more than one consignor lifts in the same cargo. The principle applied here is that a grouplifting must be represented with one parcel for each lifter (consignor).</p><p><br></p>
