  DESCRIPTION: |-
    <p>This BF is used when daily gas stream data is available. Data can be entered manually or loaded automatically. The BF requires one entry per stream per day, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all gas streams that are part of a stream set for this screen. Thus, this BF has value instantiation for the Day start where blank line for all measured gas streams will be inserted. A project can set up several instances of this screen by ensuring that correct stream data class is passed as a parameter in the tree view.</p>

    <p>The second section lists derived streams. Derived streams are calculated on the fly and are not editable. Configuration of derived streams is done in the Stream Formula Editor (CO.0081). All streams that have GRS_VOL_METHOD=&rsquo;FORMULA&rsquo; or NET_VOL_METHOD=&rsquo;FORMULA&rsquo; will be calculated using the formula configured in the Stream Formula Editor.</p>

    <p>Mandatory navigator level for Well and Stream screens can be configured in CO.1008 Maintain User Settings.</p>
    <p> - From category &ldquo;Customer Setting&rdquo;, select setting &ldquo;Custom Mandatory Navigation&rdquo;.</p>
    <p> - Add respective user role which required custom navigation.</p>
    <p> - Available custom navigation level to configure are &ldquo;AREA&rdquo;, &ldquo;FCTY_CLASS_1&rdquo;, &ldquo;PRODUCTIONUNIT&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The METHOD_OVERRIDE attribute can be used when implementation wants to change the allocated or the theoretical numbers based on certain conditions. Product have just added the attribute to hold the override value,the underneath functionality has not been added in the product. Implementation of the functionality has been left to the users.</p>
