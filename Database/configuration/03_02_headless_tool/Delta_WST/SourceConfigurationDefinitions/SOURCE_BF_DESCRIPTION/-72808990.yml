  DESCRIPTION: <p>This Business Function is part of the Business Process to gather and QA sub daily well data. It should be used when SCADA systems provide records each 2nd hour / hourly / 30min or other fixed intervals. This BF supports end user to maintain sub daily production data for specified wells. The screen lists all sub day data currently available for specified date and well. If the original data has occasional &quot;missing rows&quot; (that is, not every half hour when the fixed interval is 30 min), the &quot;<em>Generate Missing Rows</em>&quot; button will insert any missing rows so that every half hour is accounted for. For these newly inserted rows, an existing period&rsquo;s data will be used as the row&rsquo;s initial value. EC will support copy forward, copy backwards and interpolate methods for generating missing row field values; the customer may select the desired method from a screen popup list. The &quot;Aggregate Facility All&quot; will aggregate the sub-daily well information and calculate the Theoretical Oil for all wells belonging to the selected facility. In addition to the columns shown on the sample screen below, the customer may select to configure and display one or more additional columns, e.g. Prod Casing Pressure, Intermediate Casing Pressure, Surface Casing Pressure, Flow Line Temperature or Pressure after Fixed Choke and Pressure after Variable Choke.</p><p>The attribute &quot;On Test&quot; gives an indication whether or not a well is currently on test and this is only applicable for wells configured in PT.0005:Production Test Define.</p>
