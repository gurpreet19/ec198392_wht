  DESCRIPTION: <p>In a system which is balanced by summing up input nominations and comparing with sum of output nominations, this business function will give you a summary of these totals, and also list data per nomination locations.</p><p>In the top section of the screen you have the totals for the gas day, where also the Balance is calculated as the difference between Total in to the system, and Total out. There will also be a box for entering a comment for the day. This comment will be edited per Business Unit and is automatically instantiated every night. </p><p>Then below you have Input Nominations including Input Transfers on one side, and Output Nominations including Output Transfers on the other side.</p><p>Input and Output nominations allows for editing, so it is then up to the project to implement logic for splitting these quantities down to contracts if required.</p>
