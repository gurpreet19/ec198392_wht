  DESCRIPTION: <p>During loading operation, samples must be taken to properly determine the quality including water content of the lifted product. It is quite common to use an autosampler&nbsp;(device that grabs a small quantity during the complete lifting in proportion with the flow, and hence become representative for the complete volume lifted).</p><p>The analysis sample is normally subject to an immediate analysis by laboratory located at or close to the terminal, so that results can be determined quickly after&nbsp;completion of the loading. In addition, sealed bottles containing samples are kept for a period (could be several months), in case a claim situation could occur.</p><p>For crude oil, it is common to determine BS&amp;W content, API, RVP, TVP and salt content, whereas for LNG/LPG product a complete compositional analysis is often&nbsp;required. The set of analysis items are in EC configurable per product.</p><p>In this business function, the navigator displays all cargos that are not Tentative and Official. When selecting a cargo, all products for the cargo will be listed. For&nbsp;each product, analysis items are instantiated (when cargo was set to Official and Ready for Harbour), making it possible to enter different analysis values. Analysis&nbsp;items are configured for each product in Product Analysis Item (CO.2007).</p><p>The &lsquo;Expected Unload&rsquo; attribute is by default not displayed. If Cost Insurance Freight (CIF) cargos are used and Unload values are of interest, the attribute can be&nbsp;activated. The values are calculated on retrieved. How the value should be calculated must be defined by each individual implementation. It is recommended that&nbsp;this function does not return any errors since this will prevent data from being loaded into the screen.<br />There is an option of implementing a validation procedure within the ue_cargo_analysis.validate().</p>
