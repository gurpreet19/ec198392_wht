  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This business function is used when the complete cargo administration
    process is not required, typically the operation only require to capture the actual
    lifting figures to be used as basis for calculations like mass balance etc.The
    end users has the option of inserting a new cargo in data section 1 and then associate
    one or more parcels (nominations) by inserting rows in the data section 2.Cargo
    Status process is simplified by a few steps, upon inserting the cargo status should
    be default be set to a status of &ldquo;Ready for harbour&rdquo; (or equivalent).
    Then the next process step would be to forward this to &ldquo;Closed&rdquo; and
    finally &ldquo;Approved&rdquo;.</p><p>There are three tabs in this business function:
    Nomination Details, Nomination Company List and Parcel Load. By default the name
    of the tab will be taken based on the class name. It is possible to disable or
    enable these tabs in Maintain System Settings. The information displayed in the
    tabs are based on the selected parcel in second data section. The classes for
    both data sections and tabs are configurable.</p><p>Tab 1: Nomination Detail<br
    />The tab is used to view the information required on each cargo nomination on
    consignor (the lifter from which lift account the quantities will be drawn) and
    consignee (the buyer of the cargo) and the port (if multiple, only the first port
    is recorded for each cargo nomination). A nomination can be connected to a contract
    using this section. For more information please read CP.0004.</p><p>Tab 2: Nomination
    Company List<br />The tab is used to view the override and default split on Lifting
    Agreements. If The Lifting Account is set up to be connected to a Contract and
    that contract got more than one customer a default split is created when the nomination
    is created.The navigator will list the nomination for selected cargo . If the
    nomination is connected to a Lifting Agreement the split data section will list
    all customer companies associated to the Lifting Agreement (Contract).For more
    information, please read CP.0020.Default Split button is not added to this tab
    as this can be implemented by using context menu in the project.</p><p>Tab 3:
    Parcel Load<br />In this tab it shows the product measurements for each nomination.
    The Product Measurement is instantiated (when cargo was set to Official and Ready
    for Harbour), making it possible to enter lifted values for different measurement
    types and units. One of the measurement types is used as the nominated lifted
    value (nominated unit), meaning this is the value used in further calculations.
    Note that the lifted value is not editable unless the B/L Date is set. Measurement
    types and units are configured for each product (export quality) in Product Measurement
    Setup (CO.2002).For more information please read TO.0005.</p><p>Calculate button
    is not added to this tab as lifting data is coming from the terminal.</p>'
