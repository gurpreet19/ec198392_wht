  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Inter-Group Conversion screen</strong>    is used to
    define the conversion factor to be used between the different    UOM Groups (Energy,
    Mass and Volume).</p><p>    <u> The conversion can be done on three different
    levels: </u> <br> <strong> - Country </strong> as the    highest level, <br> <strong>
    - Node  </strong> and <br> <strong> - Field </strong> as the lowest level.<br>    Lower
    levels will always override higher level.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0,
    153);">    When entering the Master quantity for a Stream Item in the EC Revenue    Quantity
    module, the system can automatically calculate the quantity in    other UOMs defined
    for the Stream Item.<br>   <u> For instance,</u> the Stream Item may have Volume
    as Master quantity and also    have an Energy UOM defined.<br>    By defining
    a Conversion Factor between Volume and Energy - a GCV factor,    the system can
    calculate the energy quantity based on the volume quantity.</span></p><p>    <u>The
    following conversions are available:</u><br>    <strong>Density:</strong>    For
    converting between Volume and Mass, and vice versa<br>    <strong>GCV:</strong>    For
    converting between Volume and Energy, and vice versa<br>    <strong>MCV:</strong>    For
    converting between Mass and Energy, and vice versa</p><p>Each Stream Item has
    a configuration attribute -    <strong><em>the Conversion Method attribute</em></strong>
    - telling how to    do conversion between the different UOM Groups (Energy, Mass
    and Volume).<br>    This can be set to either:<br>    <strong><em>- Calculated</em></strong>    -
    NO automatic conversion between the different UOM Groups will be    performed.<br>    <strong><em>-
    Conversion Factor</em></strong>    - when the system will as part of the instantiation
    of the Stream Items    pick up conversion objects - either at Node, Field, or
    Country and refer to    these objects at the instantiated records, both monthly
    and daily.</p><p>    <u>The Conversion Factors</u>    are objects with normal
    versioning, but the screen is in a way treating    them as data which gives behavior
    for the screen as follows:<br>    - The screen has a Master-Detail type of layout
    where the master level    shows the latest version of the object for the selected
    year.<br>    If there is no version starting in the year given by the Year set
    in the    navigator then the newest version having a version start date prior
    to this    year is listed.<br>    - The detail section shows all versions having
    a version start date after    the 1st of January of the Year set in the navigator.</p><p>    <strong>Master
    section of the screen:</strong><br>    The Master section is read-only for all
    data elements except the End Date,    so for changing the actual conversion factors
    and UOMs the user has to set    the year selector such that the version in question
    is listed in the Detail    section.<br>    <u>Note:</u>    a side-effect of this
    is that the user will not be able to change the Code    / Name / Product / (Country/Field/Node)
    once it has been set.</p><p>    <u>Also note:</u>    It is NOT allowed to add
    a New Version for a Daytime where there is already    one, i.e. when adding a
    New Version of the object the version Daytime hasto be AFTER the latest existing
    one. If the user needs to add a New Version    <em>in between</em> then the user
    has to delete the versions having Version    Date after the one you want to add,
    and then add the New Version. Then add    back the ones just deleted.<br>    <u>Also
    note:</u>    if the user set an end-date to the object then it is not allowed
    to add new    versions.</p><p>    <strong>ConversionFactorSetup scheduler job</strong>    has
    to be enabled in order to be able to save data for this BF when the    system
    attribute CASCADE_BOE_FACT_CHANGE = MANUAL | AUTO.</p>'
