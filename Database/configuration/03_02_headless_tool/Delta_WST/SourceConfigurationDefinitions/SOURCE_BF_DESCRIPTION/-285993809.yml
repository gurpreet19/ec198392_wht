  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The Integration Services captures data from external source systems (e.g. PI, OPC HDA, Oracle JDBC) and transfers it to the EC database for permanent storage. The Maintain Mappings Overview screen is used to display various mapping configurations and do minor changes to the configuration. The screen helps the user to filter active/inactive tags, tag ids, source ids, and using class/object names.</p>

    <p>In addition, the screen provides an option to do bulk update to last transfer and status of the tags for one or selected number of rows.</p>
