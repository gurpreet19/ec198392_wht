  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Monthly Node Input screen</strong>    is used to maintain
    IP (Input) type of Stream Items, their Calc Methods and Conversion Factors.<br>    -
    Quantity numbers entered are sorted by Node.<br>    - To see all types of SI connected
    to a Node use Monthly Node Overview screen (BF VO.0022).</p><p>    <u>For each
    stream item up to 6 different quantities may be entered:</u><br>    - One Volume
    quantity<br>    - One Energy quantity<br>    - One Mass quantity<br>    - 3 Extra
    quantities, any UOM</p><p>    <u>Each stream item is defined with a master UOM
    group. That is V for Volume, M for Mass or E for Energy.</u><br>    The quantity
    is normally entered in the master UOM and other quantities are calculated by the
    system using conversion logic and cascade logic. The    following will describe
    the calculations the save operation does.</p><h3>    <strong style="color: rgb(0,
    0, 153);">Navigator</strong></h3><p>    Navigator filters Node and Field Objects
    based on a Date chosen. The user should be sure the Instantiation is done for
    the chosen Month.</p><h3>        <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Node Object

    Factors for each Stream Item in the Stream.<br>    - The conversion factors will
    be stored at Stream Item Value level.<br>    - A change in the Conversion Factors
    here will generate updates on the quantities entered in Monthly Node Overview
    screen (BF.VO0022).<br>    - The cascade logic will start to update relevant stream
    items.</p><p>    <u>Definition of the conversion factors</u><br>    <strong><em>-
    Gross Calorific Value Energy per Volume</em></strong><br>    GCV is the factor
    used to convert between Energy and Volume.<br>    <strong><em>- Density Mass per
    Volume</em></strong><br>    DENSITY is the factor used to convert between Mass
    and Volume.<br>    <strong><em>- Mass Calorific Value Energy per Mass</em></strong><br>    MCV
    is the factor used to convert between Energy and Mass.</p><p>    <strong>Button
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">RESET SELECTED CONVERSION FACTORS</span></strong><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"></span><br>    The button enables to reset the
    Conversion Factor for the selected Stream Item.<br>    - If a quantity, other
    than the master UOM quantity, is overwritten for a Stream Item, the system deletes
    the Conversion Factor that was used to calculate    the quantity.<br>    - If
    a user has changed a conversion factor or changed a non-master quantity it is
    possible to bring back the originally Conversion Factor on the selected    Stream
    Item by pressing the button. The quantity will then be recalculated.</p><p>    <strong>CONVERSION
    LOGIC</strong><br>    Each stream item is defined with a master UOM group and
    a corresponding master UOM. The 5 additional quantities are optional to use. If
    a UOM is defined    for one of the non-master quantities the conversion logic
    calculates the quantity based on a conversion factor. This conversion factor can
    be either a    standard conversion factor within a UOM group or a inter group
    conversion factor used across UOM groups i.e. a calculation from a Volume UOM
    to a Mass UOM.</p><p>    <u>UOM group conversions for a stream item takes place
    in the following situations:</u><br>    1. When the master UOM Group quantity
    changes; for all UOM Groups unless at the same time other quantities are provided
    for such UOM groups. This will    overwrite any previous calculated or manually
    entered quantities.<br>    2. When any of conversion the factors defined for a
    stream item is changed at stream item level. This will overwrite any previous
    calculated or manually    entered quantities.<br>    3. When any of the UOM Group
    quantities other than the master are NULL provided that a valid UOM is defined.
    If no UOM is defined the conversion will not    take place.</p><p>    An inter-UOM
    group conversion is always calculated from the master UOM Group quantity to any
    other UOM Group as long as a valid conversion factor is    available. This is
    independent of any enabling / disabling of data entry fields.<br>    Standard
    conversions are always within a UOM group and apply a set of standard conversion
    factors, which will apply to all such calculations in the system.</p><p>    <u>        Whenever
    a stream item is configured to use one or more of the Extra fields, the system
    will automatically perform standard UOM conversions for the        following situations:    </u><br>    1.
    When the master UOM Group quantity changes unless at the same time other quantities
    are provided for such Extra fields. This will overwrite any previous    calculated
    or manually entered quantities.<br>    2. When any of the Extra quantities are
    NULL provided that a valid UOM is defined. If no UOM is defined the conversion
    will not take place.</p><p>    The cascade logic starts also the conversion calculations
    if the other involved stream items are defined with other UOMs.</p><p>    <strong>Button
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">RUN ACCRUAL</span> </strong><br>    The button
    enables to generate Accruals for all the Stream Items currently shown in the screen,
    i.e. all Stream Items for the selected Node/Stream    combination.<br>- The accrual
    generation will only apply to those stream items having STATUS set to NULL. This
    function is only available at the    <strong><em>Input screens</em></strong>,
    i.e. the screens showing only the IP-type of Stream Items.</p>    <strong>ACCRUAL
    LOGIC</strong><br>    Each stream item will have accrual methods defined for daily
    and monthly numbers. These methods define how to calculate an accrual value based
    on other    values found in the VO environment.<br>    Only records with CALC_METHOD
    = IP is subject to automatic accrual generation.<p></p><p>    <u>The accrual methods
    for <strong>daily numbers</strong> are:</u><br>    - Month official forecast divided
    by number of days in month (PLAN_MTH).<br>    - Last available actual number for
    this line item (LAST_ACTUAL).<br>    - Month average daily number where status
    = FINAL (AVG_ACTUAL).<br>    - Manual entry (MANUAL_ENTRY).</p><p>    <u>The accrual
    methods for <strong>monthly numbers</strong> are:</u><br>    - Summarize daily
    quantities: Calculate an average daily number based on available daily quantities,
    finals or accruals, then find the monthly accrual    quantity by multiplying the
    average number with the number of days in month (SUM_DAY).<br>    - Previous month
    latest available value, finals or accruals (PREV_MTH)<br>    - Months official
    forecast (PLAN_MTH)<br>    - Manual entry (MANUAL_ENTRY).</p><p>    The accrual
    calculation is triggered whenever a user save a stream item value record where
    status is ACCRUAL and the master UOM Group quantity is NULL. The    system will
    not track whether a figure was entered manually or calculated using an accrual
    method. The only possibility to re-calculate an accrual is to    change the master
    UOM Group quantity to NULL and save the record.</p><p>    In the same manner as
    the cascade logic works, the accrual methods will only calculate the new master
    UOM Group quantity. Other dependent figures are    calculated using appropriate
    conversion factors, consistent with any other update of a stream item value record.</p><p>        <strong>Button
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">ACCRUAL TO FINAL FOR ALL SI IN SCREEN</span></strong><br>    The
    button will bring back all Stream Items in the screen from Accrual to Final, i.e.
    all Stream Items for the selected Node/Stream combination.</p><p>    <strong>Button
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">VIEW CASCADE</span></strong><br>    The button
    explains how the selected number was calculated using other numbers.</p><p>    <strong>CASCADE
    LOGIC</strong><br>    A stream item is defined with a calculation method (STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD).</p><p>    <u>Valid
    values for STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD</u><br>    <strong><em>- IP</em></strong>    :
    Manual input or by interface.<br>    <strong><em>- SK</em></strong>    Calculated
    using a split key. The split keys are defined in the CD module.<br>    <strong><em>-
    FO:</em></strong>    Calculated using a formula. The formula is defined on the
    stream item in the CD module.<br>    <strong><em>- EK:</em></strong>    Calculated
    using an exceptional split key, i.e. the number has been calculated based on a
    new split key share entered by the user.<br>    <strong><em>- OW:</em></strong>    The
    user has overwritten the master quantity on a FO or a SK stream item. This means
    the cascade will not include the stream item again in any new cascade    operation.<br>    <strong><em>-
    CO:</em></strong>    The number is a constant.<br>    <strong><em>- SP:</em></strong>    The
    number is coming from SP (Sales and Purchases module) and is a sum of quantities
    from one or more SP documents.</p><p>    <u>The cascade operation for a stream
    item will run automatically by the following situations:</u><br>    1. If any
    quantity in the volume/mass/energy fields has been changed by user.<br>    2.
    If the split share changes (calc_method SK to EK).<br>    3. If the conversion
    factors changes.</p><p>    The cascade operation will calculate all numbers depending
    on the number entered. The cascade calculation process is a recursive operation
    where each    number that has been recalculated may lead to recalculation of other
    stream item values as well. The cascade process will calculate only those stream
    item    values having STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD / STIM_MTH_VALUE.CALC_METHOD
    set to SK, EK or FO.</p><p>    The cascade logic itself will only calculate the
    master UOM group quantity of a stream item. Upon saving the calculated figure
    further conversion logic    will apply, i.e. across to other quantities, either
    within same UOM group or a different one.</p><h3>    <strong style="color: rgb(0,
