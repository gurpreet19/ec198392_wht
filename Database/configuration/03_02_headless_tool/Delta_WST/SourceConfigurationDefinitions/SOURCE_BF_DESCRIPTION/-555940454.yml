  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Document Valid 2 screen</strong> handles the Document Level
    change from VALID1 to VALID2 or to OPEN.&nbsp;The Static Navigator selection determines
    which documents to list in the screen. If the Document Level selector has been
    set to VALID1 the system will list documents at this level and the user can change
    Document Level for a document by ticking the appropriate level tick box followed
    by a Save operation. More than one document can be ticked before saving.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The
    Validation screens enables the user to change Document Level for a document.</strong></p><p>The
    Document Level follows a level hierarchy as follows: OPEN - VALID 1 - VALID 2
    - TRANSFER - BOOKED.</p><p>There are separate validation screens to handle the
    following Document Level changes:</p><ul><li>Document VALID2: Change level from
    VALID1 to VALID2 or from VALID1 to OPEN</li><li>Document TRANSFER: Change level
    from VALID2 to TRANSFER or from VALID2 to OPEN</li><li>Document UN-TRANSFER: Change
    level from TRANSFER to OPEN</li><li>Document BOOKED: Change level from TRANSFER
    to BOOKED</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The screen is divided into these sections:</p><ul><li><strong>Static
    Navigator</strong>: Defines the search criteria for the Document List</li><li><strong>Current
    Booking/Reporting periods:</strong> Show the current Booking / Reporting periods
    for the selected Financial Document. This section is read-only.</li><li><strong>Document
    List</strong>: Lists all the Financial Documents found matching the Static Navigator
    criteria.</li><li><strong>Information Tab</strong>: Lists details for the Financial
    Document selected in the Document List section.</li><li><strong>Reports Tab:</strong>
    For managing Reports related to the selected Financial Document</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The
    <strong>Toggle tick boxes</strong> button toggles all the "Set to VALID2" tick
    boxes. This screen will by default have Document Level set to VALID1 in the Static
    Navigator.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Other features of the screen:</p><ul><li>Clearing
    out the Level field in the Navigator will list Financial Documents at all Document
    Level. When doing this the check-boxes to move the Financial Document to Valid
    2 or Open is not possible.</li><li>Documents where the User ID for setting the
    document to VALID1 is the same as the current User ID will not be listed if the
    current Document Level for the document is VALID1. This to prevent the same user
    (i.e. same User ID) from doing both VALID1 and VALID2 validation.</li><li>When
    setting the Document Level selector in the Static Navigator to any other value
    than VALID1 the user can view documents having other Document Levels. In this
    case it is not possible to change level for any document.</li><li>When setting
    a document to VALID 2 the system will generate the Document Number. The report
    selector makes it possible to preview any configured report for the selected document.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Button
