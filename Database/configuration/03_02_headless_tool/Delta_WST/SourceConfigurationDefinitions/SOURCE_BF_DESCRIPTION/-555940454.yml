  DESCRIPTION: "<p>\t<strong>Document Valid 2 screen</strong>  handles the Document\
    \ Level change from VALID1 to VALID2 or to OPEN. &nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:\
    \ 13.33px;\">The Static Navigator selection determines which documents to list\
    \ in the screen. If the Document Level selector has been set to VALID1 the system\
    \ will list documents at this level and the user can change Document Level for\
    \ a document by <br>  ticking the appropriate level tick box followed by a Save\
    \ operation. More than one document can be ticked before saving.</span></p><p>It\
    \ is divided into three sections:</p><dir><li><strong>Static Navigator</strong>:\
    \ Defines the search criteria for the Document List</li> <li><strong>Document\
    \ List</strong>: Lists all the documents found matching the Static Navigator criteria.</li><li><strong>Document\
    \ Details</strong>: Lists details for the document selected in the Document List\
    \ section.</li></dir><p>\t<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">\t\tThe </span><strong\
    \ style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Toggle tick boxes</strong><span style=\"font-size:\
    \ 10pt;\"> button toggles all the \"Set to VALID2\" tick boxes. This screen will\
    \ by default have Document Level set to VALID1 in the Static Navigator.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\
    \    - Documents where the User ID for setting the document to VALID1 is the same\
    \ as the current User ID will not be listed if the current Document Level for\
    \ the    document is VALID1. This to prevent the same user (i.e. same User ID)\
    \ from doing both VALID1 and VALID2 validation.</p><p>    - When setting the Document\
    \ Level selector in the Static Navigator to any other value than VALID1 the user\
    \ can view documents having other Document Levels.    In this case it is not possible\
    \ to change level for any document.</p><p>    - When setting a document to VALID\
    \ 2 the system will generate the Document Number. The report selector makes it\
    \ possible to preview any configured report for    the selected document.\t</p><p><strong>Validations\
    \ screen enables user to change Document Level for a document.</strong>\t\t<br>\
    \    The Document Level follows a level hierarchy as follows: OPEN - VALID 1 -\
    \ VALID 2 - TRANSFER - BOOKED. <br>  \t\tThere are separate validation screens\
    \ to handle the following Document Level changes:</p>\t\t\t<dir><li>Document VALID2:\
    \ Change level from VALID1 to VALID2 or from VALID1 to OPEN</li> <li>Document\
    \ TRANSFER: Change level from VALID2 to TRANSFER or from VALID2 to OPEN</li> <li>Document\
    \ UN-TRANSFER: Change level from TRANSFER to OPEN</li><li>Document BOOKED: Change\
    \ level from TRANSFER to BOOKED</li></dir><p></p>\t<p>    All SP screens are used\
    \ for four different purposes based on Financial Code:\t\t\t\t<dir><li><strong>Sales:</strong>\
    \  This is sales of different hydrocarbons.</li> <li><strong>Purchases:</strong>\
    \  This is purchases of different hydrocarbons.</li> <li><strong>Tariff Income:</strong>\
    \  This is revenues/sales from use of pipeline capacity or any other service.</li>\
    \ <li><strong>Tariff Cost:</strong>  This is costs/purchases from use of pipeline\
    \ capacity or any other service.</li></dir>\t<p></p><p>    The different financial\
    \ codes are: SALE used for sales, PURCHASE used for purchases, TA_INCOME used\
    \ for tariff income and TA_COST used for tariff cost.    SALE and TA_INCOME are\
    \ both considered as sales while PURCHASE and TA_COST are considered as purchases.</p><p><strong>Reports:</strong>\t\

    \ sections for: </p><p><strong>1. Data section: Reports</strong> \t\t<br>   This\
