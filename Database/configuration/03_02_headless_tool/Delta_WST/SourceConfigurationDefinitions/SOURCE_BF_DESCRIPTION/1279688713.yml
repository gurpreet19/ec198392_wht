  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is an overview of the nomination for all contracts on a delivery point.</p><p>Daily nominations can be received into EC from the messaging system, but it is also allowed to enter a nomination manually. When a messaging system is not used&nbsp;it is recommended to use the Daily Nomination (SD.0002) business function.</p><p>If a messaging system is used the details for the message can be viewed. If for some reason the nomination does not pass the validation rules the nomination&nbsp;should be rejected and the attribute &lsquo;Nominated Qty&rsquo; should be empty. Otherwise the nomination should be accepted and &lsquo;Nominated Qty&rsquo; will have an value. Note&nbsp;that the validation rules are individual for each implementing project.</p><p>If required, the user can manually enter/update the value in the &lsquo;Nominated Qty&rsquo; attribute. This value will be subjected to validation defined on the contract in the&nbsp;attribute &lsquo;NOMINATION_VALIDATION&rsquo;. This can be same or something different then for nominations received through the messaging system. In this manner it is&nbsp;possible to manually &ldquo;force&rdquo; the acceptance of nominations that break the contractual rules.</p>
