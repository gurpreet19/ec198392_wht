  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Daily Quantity Input screen</strong> shows a list of all
    IP (Input) type of Stream Items for a particular day based on a set of query parameters.
    The result of the query will list all stream items matching the selection criteria.</p><p>
    - To see all types of SI matching the set of query parameters use Daily Quantity
    Overview screen (BF VO.0018).</p><p><u>For each stream item up to 6 different
    quantities may be entered:</u></p><p> - One Volume quantity</p><p> - One Energy
    quantity</p><p> - One Mass quantity</p><p> - 3 Extra quantities, any UOM</p><p><u>Each
    stream item is defined with a master UOM group. That is V for Volume, M for Mass
    or E for Energy.</u></p><p> The quantity is normally entered in the master UOM
    and other quantities are calculated by the system using conversion logic and cascade
    logic. The following will describe the calculations the save operation does.</p><h3><strong

    has to be filled out. Also some of the other parameters have to be set in order
    to avoid download of too many stream items. Leaving a parameter blank will act
    as a wildcard for the parameter.</p><p> - The user should be sure the Instantiation
    is done for the chosen Date.</p><h3><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"> Overview
    Table Tab</strong></h3><p>In this section the user is able to view and modify
    Conversion Factors for any Stream Item matching parameters chosen in Navigator.</p><p>
    - The conversion factors will be stored at Stream Item Value level.</p><p> - A
    change in the Conversion Factors here will generate updates on the quantities
    entered in Daily Quantity Overview screen (BF.VO0018).</p><p> - The cascade logic
    will start to update relevant stream items.</p><p><u>Definition of the conversion

    GCV is the factor used to convert between Energy and Volume.</p><p> <strong><em>
    - Density Mass per Volume</em></strong></p><p> DENSITY is the factor used to convert
    between Mass and Volume.</p><p> <strong><em> - Mass Calorific Value Energy per

    Mass.</p><p><strong>Button </strong><strong style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">RESET
    SELECTED CONVERSION FACTORS</strong></p><p> The button enables to reset the Conversion
    Factor for the selected Stream Item.</p><p> - If a quantity, other than the master
    UOM quantity, is overwritten for a Stream Item, the system deletes the Conversion
    Factor that was used to calculate the quantity.</p><p> - If a user has changed
    a conversion factor or changed a non-master quantity it is possible to bring back
    the originally Conversion Factor on the selected Stream Item by pressing the button.
    The quantity will then be recalculated.</p><p><strong>CONVERSION LOGIC</strong></p><p>
    Each stream item is defined with a master UOM group and a corresponding master
    UOM. The 5 additional quantities are optional to use. If a UOM is defined for
    one of the non-master quantities the conversion logic calculates the quantity
    based on a conversion factor. This conversion factor can be either a standard
    conversion factor within a UOM group or a inter group conversion factor used across
    UOM groups i.e. a calculation from a Volume UOM to a Mass UOM.</p><p><u>UOM group
    conversions for a stream item takes place in the following situations:</u></p><p>
    1. When the master UOM Group quantity changes; for all UOM Groups unless at the
    same time other quantities are provided for such UOM groups. This will overwrite
    any previous calculated or manually entered quantities.</p><p> 2. When any of
    conversion the factors defined for a stream item is changed at stream item level.
    This will overwrite any previous calculated or manually entered quantities.</p><p>
    3. When any of the UOM Group quantities other than the master are NULL provided
    that a valid UOM is defined. If no UOM is defined the conversion will not take
    place.</p><p>An inter-UOM group conversion is always calculated from the master
    UOM Group quantity to any other UOM Group as long as a valid conversion factor
    is available. This is independent of any enabling / disabling of data entry fields.</p><p>
    Standard conversions are always within a UOM group and apply a set of standard
    conversion factors, which will apply to all such calculations in the system.</p><p><u>
    Whenever a stream item is configured to use one or more of the Extra fields, the
    system will automatically perform standard UOM conversions for the following situations:
    </u></p><p> 1. When the master UOM Group quantity changes unless at the same time
    other quantities are provided for such Extra fields. This will overwrite any previous
    calculated or manually entered quantities.</p><p> 2. When any of the Extra quantities
    are NULL provided that a valid UOM is defined. If no UOM is defined the conversion
    will not take place.</p><p>The cascade logic starts also the conversion calculations
    if the other involved stream items are defined with other UOMs.</p><p><strong>Button
    </strong><strong style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"> ACCRUAL TO FINAL FOR ALL SI IN
    SCREEN</strong></p><p> The button will bring back all Stream Items in the screen
    from Accrual to Final.</p><p><strong>Button </strong><strong style="color: rgb(0,
    153, 0);"> VIEW CASCADE </strong></p><p> The button explains how the selected
    number was calculated using other numbers.</p><p><strong>CASCADE LOGIC</strong></p><p>
    A stream item is defined with a calculation method (STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD).</p><p><u>Valid
    values for STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD</u></p><p> <strong><em>- IP</em></strong>
    : Manual input or by interface.</p><p> <strong><em>- SK</em></strong> Calculated
    using a split key. The split keys are defined in the CD module.</p><p> <strong><em>-
    FO:</em></strong> Calculated using a formula. The formula is defined on the stream
    item in the CD module.</p><p> <strong><em>- EK:</em></strong> Calculated using
    an exceptional split key, i.e. the number has been calculated based on a new split
    key share entered by the user.</p><p> <strong><em>- OW:</em></strong> The user
    has overwritten the master quantity on a FO or a SK stream item. This means the
    cascade will not include the stream item again in any new cascade operation.</p><p>
    <strong><em>- CO:</em></strong> The number is a constant.</p><p> <strong><em>-
    SP:</em></strong> The number is coming from SP (Sales and Purchases module) and
    is a sum of quantities from one or more SP documents.</p><p><u>The cascade operation
    for a stream item will run automatically by the following situations:</u></p><p>
    1. If any quantity in the volume/mass/energy fields has been changed by user.</p><p>
    2. If the split share changes (calc_method SK to EK).</p><p> 3. If the conversion
    factors changes.</p><p>The cascade operation will calculate all numbers depending
    on the number entered. The cascade calculation process is a recursive operation
    where each number that has been recalculated may lead to recalculation of other
    stream item values as well. The cascade process will calculate only those stream
    item values having STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD / STIM_MTH_VALUE.CALC_METHOD set
    to SK, EK or FO.</p><p>The cascade logic itself will only calculate the master
    UOM group quantity of a stream item. Upon saving the calculated figure further
    conversion logic will apply, i.e. across to other quantities, either within same
    UOM group or a different one.</p><h3><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"> Conversion
