  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This BF defines Price Concepts and the Price Elements that belong
    to each Price Concept. The Price Concepts are used when defining Price Objects
    for use in Transaction Templates in the Financial Transaction area, for Inventory
    Price Objects in the Inventory module, and for the General Price Objects.</p><p>The
    Price Elements for a given Price Concept will be the Quantity type Line Items
    in the generated Documents.</p><p>For each Price Concept one can define which
    of the Financial Areas each Price Concept is available to. One can also set the
    Contract Area in order to limit the Price Concept to be used within a single Contract
    Area. For each Price Concept one can also define the corresponding INCOTERM which
    is an international standardization of custody transfer concepts.</p><p>Please
    note that the Transaction Date Method is no longer in use and can be left blank</p><p>For
    each of the Price Elements connected to a Price Concept one can set whether the
    quantity associated with the line item in the Document will be moved into the
    EC Revenue Quantity module or not when the Document is set to Booked by setting
    the &lsquo;Move Quantity to VO&rsquo; tick. In the example in the screenshot above
    the only the Product Value line item quantity will be moved to the EC Revenue
    Quantity module when the Document is set to Booked. Please note that when there
    are more than one Price Element for a Price Concept normally only one of them
    should have the &lsquo;Move Quantity to VO&rsquo; ticked to avoid double-counting
    of the quantities in the Quantity module.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Price Concept CIF
    example with separate Price Elements for Cost (C), Insurance (I), and Freight
    (F). In this case the quantities related to Insurance and Freight should NOT be
    moved to VO.</p><p>Product Value: 100 000 BBLS 25 USD/BBLS = 2 500 000 USD Move
    Qty To VO = Y</p><p>Insurance: 100 000 BBLS 2 USD/BBLS = 200 000 USD Move Qty
    To VO = N</p><p>Freight: 101 000 BBLS 2 USD/BBLS = 202 000 USD Move Qty To VO
    = N</p><p>The Group indicator is for the interface to the Financial System as
    well as for use in the Invoice Hardcopy &ndash; by setting the Group Indicator
    the Price Elements that has this set will be added together in the interface /
    invoice hardcopy. In the example in the screenshot above the Freight and Insurance
    line items will be added together in the interface / Invoice hardcopy.</p><p>For
    each Price Element one defines the DEFAULT Line Item Type for the Price Element.
    This can be changed in each Transaction Template where it is used.</p><p>The Line
    Item Type is one of the attributes that can be used for having separate Account
    Mapping and Cost Object Mapping to get various posting data for the Line Item.</p>'
