  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This Business Function supports defining oil, gas, water, gas lift and diluent volume rate estimates for oil production wells. Several estimates can be defined withinthe same production day each having an effective start daytime.</p>

    <p>These estimates are typically used during</p>

    <p>Well bean-ups. The bean up process includes several steps before reaching normal flow. Each step can have an associated estimated flow rate with an effective start daytime.</p>

    <p>Periods where well production is reduced due to facility having limited capacity for a given period</p>

    <p>Well estimates will only have effect on well theoretical calculations if well is set up with <em>Theoretical calc method = &lsquo;Well Test and well estimates&rsquo;.</em></p>

    <p>This theoretical calculation method will use a combination of accepted well tests and production well estimates when calculating a daily well theoretical value.Note that a well estimate or a well test is valid until replaced by a new well estimate or a new approved well test.</p>

    <p>The &lsquo;Well Estimates&rsquo; data section will show all estimates valid within the chosen period.</p>

    <p>Screen section <em>Approved Well Tests </em>will display all approved well tests valid within the period specified in the navigator. It will also include the last approved well test prior to the specified period. This is for information only and can be of help when estimating a new rate for a new choke setting.</p>

    <p><strong>Oil calculations</strong></p>

    <p>Well estimate oil rate can be specified either as a net oil rate or a combination of a gross oil rate and bsw %. If both a gross and a net oil rate is specified the net oil rate will be used in calculations, but if missing the system will calculate net oil rate as gross oil rate * (1-bsw%).</p>

    <p><strong>Gas calculations</strong></p>

    <p>Well estimate gas rate can be specified as a gas rate (net any gas lift) or as a combination of net oil rate and GOR. In the calculation the estimate net gas rate takes precedence in calculations, but if net gas rate is missing the system will calculate gas based on net oil rate and * GOR.</p>

    <p><strong>Water calculations</strong></p>

    <p>Well estimate water rate water will be calculated based on water rate + gross oil rate and bsw%. If any of the two is null, it will be treated as zero in the calculation.</p>

    <p><strong>Gas Lift calculations</strong></p>

    <p>Well estimate gas lift rate is specified as a daily rate directly.</p>

    <p><strong>Diluent calculations</strong></p>

    <p>Well estimate diluent rate is specified as a daily rate directly.</p>
