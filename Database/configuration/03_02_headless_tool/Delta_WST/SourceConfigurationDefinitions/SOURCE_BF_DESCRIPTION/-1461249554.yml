  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This screen allows you to create, delete, and modify logical business actions. These logical business actions are the contract for what specific arguments a business action can take, i.e. the logical method definition for the business action. Typically this screen will be used during initial setup of the scheduler. It may also be used to define any customer specific business actions or business action customizations. Business actions must be defined prior to use in the scheduler.</p>
