  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This screen will be used to configure the many to many relation between Facility Class 1/2 and External Location. Each connection has a start and end date + an optional sort order which will be used instead-of name in the truck ticket Business Function (if it&rsquo;s not null). These connections will be used in the truck tickets screens to identify from where the truck comes from or to where it&rsquo;s going.</p>
