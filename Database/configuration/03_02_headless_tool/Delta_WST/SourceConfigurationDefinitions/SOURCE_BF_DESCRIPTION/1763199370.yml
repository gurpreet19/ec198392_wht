  DESCRIPTION: '<p>There is a requirement to limit a list of objects that appear in
    a screen based on a type, etc. The initial requirement was on Gas Sales Contracts,
    but we have similar solutions for Streams, Tanks and Wells today. This specification
    will specify a generic concept that enable this functionality. The focus is on
    Gas Sale Contracts, but in the future this can be adopted by existing and future
    requirements.</p><p>The idea of a business function profile or a class profile
    is that whenever a new Gas Sale Contract is created it will be associated with
    a profile from a list of different profiles. Each profile is associated with one
    or several business functions. Each business function will then have to implement
    functionality which ensures that only contracts associated with profiles that
    uses the business function will be listed/available in the screen.</p><p>An attribute
    called BF_PROFILE must be added to the class where this is used.</p><p>The list
    of business functions and classes (GAS_CONTRACT, STREAM, TANK and WELL) that uses
    the profile concept is part of the products. The profiles and usage of the business
    functions are decided by the individual implementation projects.</p><p>Note! The
    screen is part of EC Framework, but the different classes and business functions
    are individually configured in the product.</p><p>The Business Function Profile
    was also introduced for Well Finder screen use. It is preconfigured with 4 types
    of PROFILE_CODE for Well Class as following:</p><p><strong>PROD</strong> Production
    Well Profile</p><p><strong>INJ</strong> Injection Well Profile</p><p><strong>PRODINJ</strong>
    Production and Injection Well Profile</p><p><strong>OBSERV</strong> Observation
    Well Profile</p><p>These Business Function Profile codes were configured with
    the selected WR.XXXX Well Business Functions based on its usage. The Well Finder
    screen will lead users to go to the respective Well Business Function directly
    if the Well object has been configured with the correct Business Function Profile
    code. It offers users another way to navigate to the Well Business Function screens
    without using the Tree view.</p><p>In addition, users would define their own profile
    codes with a specific scope of business functions. For instance: the Steam Injector
    Business Functions.</p>'
