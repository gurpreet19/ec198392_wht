  DESCRIPTION: <p>This screen is the main screen for monitoring and handling of all messages in and out of Energy Components (EC).</p><p>Outgoing messages generated by EC subsystems and accepted for transmission by rule or user acknowledgment are available in this screen. The usual processing sequence is that the message is "Prepared", "Accepted", "Pending" and "Sent" directly out to the external company set as receiver of the message. If something fails the message will get status "Error", which can be acknowledged by the user. An error can be a failure to transfer the message, parsing error, etc.</p><p>Messages arriving into the system will have a processing sequence with "Pending", "Accepted" and "Processed". If the message requires manual acknowledgement, it will not proceed from "Accepted" before the message is accepted by a user in the "Incoming Messages" screen. Should data loading fail, the message will receive "Not loaded" status. If the system cannot interpret the message, it gets status "Error".</p><p>In order to highlight deviations that require user attention, messages with status "Error" and "Not loaded" will be listed at the top of the list no matter what the search criteria is set to.</p><p>Note that the system property “Reply Default Message Code” must be configured with a message type code corresponding to an actual message type in order to be able to use the reply button.</p>
