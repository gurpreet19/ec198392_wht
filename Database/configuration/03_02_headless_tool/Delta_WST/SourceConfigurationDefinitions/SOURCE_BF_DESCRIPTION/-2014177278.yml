  DESCRIPTION: <p>The Create Library Calculation screen is used to define new library calculations and add new versions to existing library calculations. The screen is also used for basic maintenance like deleting and exporting library calculations.</p><p>A library calculation is a calculation that is not run on its own, but is rather used as a sub-step in other calculations. The actual content of a library calculation is not defined in this screen, except for the base type of the calculation (Process Diagram, Equations or Excel Workbook). For more information on library calculations in general, calculation types and how the content of a calculation is defined, see the BF <em>Maintain Library Calculation (CO.1062)</em>.</p><p>The <em>Expected Inherited Sets</em> section can be used to define sets that the library calculation assumes to be defined in the calling calculation. This is a simple mechanism for "passing" sets from the caller to the library calculation (although technically speaking it is not really passed, but rather inherited). These sets can be used within the library calculation in the same manner as any other inherited set.</p><p>Similarly, the <em>Expected Inherited Local Variables</em> section can be used to specify any variables that the library calculation assumes to be in scope from the caller calculation. These can be used to "pass" variable data between the caller and the library calculation, and can be used in the library calculation in the same way as any other variable.</p><p>During certain upgrades, the additional attribute "Use Old Object Version Rules" will be added to this screen. This flag can be set on existing calculations to disable the improved, but stricter, syntax requirements in EC11 and certain service packs. This flag should never be set on new calculations. <br></p>
