  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used when daily production well data are available per production well and the well is directly connected to a facility, without any intermediate flowline /pipeline systems.</p>

    <p>Data can be entered manually or automatically. The BF requires one entry per well per day, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all active producing wells having the attribute INSTRUMENTATION_TYPE set to Instrumentation Type 1. In addition to that, the production well is recognized by having attribute WELL_CLASS set to &lsquo;P&rsquo; (Producer) or &lsquo;PI&rsquo; (Producer and Injector).</p>

    <p>This BF is actually a variant of the WR.0001 &ndash; Daily Production Well Status 1, but with a different navigator type to display the records for a well throughout a period. It will have reference to the WR.0001, and the values for both BF should match. It is very similar to other Period Production Well Status 2 and Period Production Well Status 3. The only difference is the wells that are associated have different instrumentation types.</p>
