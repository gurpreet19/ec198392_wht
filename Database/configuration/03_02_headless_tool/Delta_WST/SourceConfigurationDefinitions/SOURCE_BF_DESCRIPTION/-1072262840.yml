  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The initiate day screen contains a button that invokes the instantiation
    that is configured as EC codes using the code_type INITIATE_DAY. The instantiation
    procedures run might also be procedures instantiating for other product areas
    like transport and sales. This will then be configured equally as EC codes within
    the respective product area.</p><p>By default two stored procedures for production
    instantiation are configured in EC codes to be run by this button:</p><p> <b>ec_bs_instantiate.new_day_start(start_date):</b>
    This procedure creates a new date in a table holding only valid production dates.
    This happens at the beginning of the production day.</p><p> <b>ec_bs_instantiate.new_day_end(start_date,end_date):</b>
    This procedure creates a new record for all classes and objects having instantiation.
    If a new object has been defined effective back in time, you must rerun this process
    manually to include this new object. The process will not damage any existing
    records.</p><p>There is also one stored procedure for transport instantiation
    and one stored procedure for sales instantiation configured in EC codes to be
    run by this button:</p><p> <b>ec_bs_tran_instantiate.new_day_end(start_date,end_date):</b>
    This procedure creates a new record for all classes and objects having instantiation
    in EC Transport module. If a new object has been defined effective back in time,
    you must rerun this process manually to include this new object. The process will
    not damage any existing records.</p><p> <b>ec_bs_sale_instantiate.new_day_end(start_date,end_date):</b>
    This procedure creates a new record for all classes and objects having instantiation
    in EC Sales module. If a new object has been defined effective back in time, you
    must rerun this process manually to include this new object. The process will
    not damage any existing records.</p><p>In addition, a user-exit instantiation
    procedure is configured to be run. The user-exit procedure might also be used
    to include user-exit functionality for areas not covered by standard product function.</p><p><b>Initiate
    Day Future Date:</b> If  the user wants to initiate for future dates, go to the
    Maintain System Settings (CO.1006) -&gt; Custom Settings -&gt; Set ‘Initiate Day:
    Allow future date instantiation’ = ‘Y’. The default behavior for this attribute
    is ‘N’, i.e. no future day instantiation is allowed.</p><p><b>Initiate Day Revision
    Text Update:</b> If the user wants to update the revision text during insert or
    update for tables, go to Maintain System Settings (CO.1006) -&gt; Custom Settings
    -&gt; Set ‘Initiate Day: Allow Revision Text Update during instantiation’ = ‘Y’.
    This is default behavior. If the user doesn''t want to update the revision text,
    set ‘Initiate Day: Allow Revision Text Update during instantiation’ = ‘N’.</p><p>These
    five jobs are scheduled to start automatically by Oracle. Under normal operations,
    there is no need to run these manually.</p>'
