  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to configure a new price index. Each price index has a single daily, monthly or yearly value. Where there are multiple values associated with an index (e.g. high value and low values), these would be configured within EC as separate indices (e.g. PLT_LSFO_LOW, PLT_LSFO_HIGH).</p><p>A price index is typically used as input to Price Calculation. When long term contracts (e.g. 20 years) are negotiated they will typically agree on some price indexes to be used in the price calculation for the contract. This is to make sure that over time the prices calculated will change according to changes in the market etc.</p>
