  DESCRIPTION: <p>When validating the nominations there can be many boundaries that will indicate minimum and maximum acceptable nominations based on contractual rules. This&nbsp;screen can be used to store away calculated values for daily and sub daily boundaries.</p><p>The screen will be built on a generic table allowing project to use the same screen and database table to store boundaries for other objects, by creating project&nbsp;specific classes which are given in as url parameters, and by specifying the target and the navigation model also as url parameters.</p>
