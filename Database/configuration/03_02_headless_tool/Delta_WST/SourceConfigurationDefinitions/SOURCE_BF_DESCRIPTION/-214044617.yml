    0, 153);">FI Transactional Data Section</strong></h3><p>This section shows the
    transactional data for FI entries. <u>FI Transactional Data section has these
    features:</u></p><p><strong>Sort Order: </strong></p><ul><li>This is a sort order
    of the FI entry. It gives a possibility to sort all records in the screen.</li><li>By
    default, a newer FI entry is set to the lowest number of the sort order to appear
    on top of the list of FI entries.</li></ul><p><strong>Financial Item Source Object
    Name:</strong></p><ul><li>This is an original Name of the FI object created in
    the FI Definition screen.</li><li>It can''t be changed by the user in any other
    screen, but it can be replaced with the selected FI object in the dropdown.</li></ul><p><strong>Financial
    Item Name:</strong></p><ul><li>This is an optional name given to FI entry by the
    user. Can not be left blank.</li><li>By default it has the same Name as FI Source
    Object.</li></ul><p><strong>Item Type:</strong></p><ul><li>This is a type of the
    FI that can be either Cost, Income or Quantity. Read-only data.</li></ul><p><strong>Value
    for the FI entry</strong> can be:</p><ul><li>Interfaced Value - interfaced from
    the external system,</li><li>Calculated Value - calculated inside EC,</li><li>Override
    Value - manually adjusted by the user.</li></ul><p><strong>Value by Priority:</strong></p><ul><li>This
    column shows the boss-value for the FI entry.</li><li>Override value has always
    highest priority among others.</li><li>Calculated or Interfaced value priority
    is controlled by Fallback method that is set in FI Definition screen (for the
    FI Source object).</li><li>Value by priority will be dynamically updated for all
    FI entries in provisional status only, when fallback method is updated on FI Definition
    screen.</li><li>If fallback value is updated when FI entry is in verified/approved
    state, value by priority will be updated when FI entry is put back to provisional
    status.</li></ul><p><strong>Currency / UOM:</strong></p><ul><li>Represents the
    unit of measure for the FI object. It is either a list of currencies or a list

    transactional level.</u></li></ul><p><strong>Derived checkbox:</strong></p><ul><li>If
    it is set, it means that the FI value was calculated from the other FI entry (that
    the value is coming from another value). The thinking behind is to avoid doubling
    of the data and values (for reporting purposes) as one FI entry can already hold
    other entries in.</li></ul><p><strong>Dataset:</strong></p><ul><li>Datasets are
    created for the FI object in the FI Definition screen (Dataset Tab).</li><li>Inserting
    a FI entry in the screen the user can:</li><li class="ql-indent-1">choose one

    blank. After saving EC will automatically create one FI record for each of the
    datasets that are configured for the FI object</li><li>Dataset field can''t be
    left blank. It should always have a value <u>at transactional level.</u></li></ul><p><strong>Object
    Link Type:</strong></p><ul><li>Even though Object Link Type is defined for the
    FI object in the FI Definition screen, the field is still editable.</li><li>Object
    Link Type field can''t be left blank. It should always have value <u>at transactional

    the field is empty <u>at transactional level.</u></li></ul><p><strong>Cost Object:
    </strong></p><ul><li>The list of cost objects in the dropdown is dependent on
    the Cost Object Type.</li><li>If Cost Object Type is set to "None" for the FI
    object in the FI Definition screen, Cost Object field is disabled <u>at transactional
    level.</u></li></ul><p><strong>ERP Cost Object Code</strong> is coming from FI
    Template screen.</p><p><strong>Company</strong> is a certain Company the FI entry
    can be linked to.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong></p><ul><li>The user must be able
