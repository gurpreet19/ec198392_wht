  DESCRIPTION: "<p>\t<strong>Document Booked screen</strong>    handles the Document\
    \ Level change from TRANSFER to BOOKED. The Static Navigator selection determines\
    \ which documents to list in the screen. If the Document    Level selector has\
    \ been set to TRANSFER the system will list documents at this level and the user\
    \ can change Document Level for a document by ticking the    appropriate level\
    \ tick box followed by a Save operation. More than one document can be ticked\
    \ before saving.</p><p>This screen is divided into three sections:    <dir>\t\t\
    <li>\t\t\t<strong>Static Navigator</strong>: Defines the search criteria for the\
    \ Document List.</li>\t\t<li>\t\t\t<strong>Document List</strong>: Lists all the\
    \ documents found matching the Static Navigator criteria.</li>\t\t<li>\t\t\t<strong>Document\
    \ Details</strong>: Lists details for the document selected in the Document List\
    \ section.</li>\t</dir><p></p><p>    The <strong>Toggle tick boxes</strong> button\
    \ toggles all the \"Set to BOOKED tick boxes. This screen will by default have\
    \ Document Level set to TRANSFER in    the Static Navigator.</p><p>    - When\
    \ setting the Document Level selector in the Static Navigator to any other value\
    \ than TRANSFER the user can view documents having other Document    Levels. In\
    \ this case it is not possible to change level for any document.</p><p>    - A\
    \ document can not change level to BOOKED unless the CONT_DOCUMENT.FIN_INTERFACE_IND\
    \ has been set by a successful TRANSFER operation.</p><p>        In the <strong>report\
    \ selector</strong> the user can select one of the configured reports for the\
    \ selected document and preview it.</p><p>\t<strong>Validations screen enables\
    \ user to change Document Level for a document.</strong>\t<br>    The Document\
    \ Level follows a level hierarchy as follows: OPEN - VALID 1 - VALID 2 - TRANSFER\
    \ - BOOKED.<br>    There are separate validation screens to handle the following\
    \ Document Level changes:<dir>\t\t\t\t<li>Document VALID2: Change level from VALID1\
    \ to VALID2 or from VALID1 to OPEN</li>\t\t\t\t<li>Document TRANSFER: Change level\
    \ from VALID2 to TRANSFER or from VALID2 to OPEN</li>\t\t\t\t<li>Document UN-TRANSFER:\
    \ Change level from TRANSFER to OPEN</li>\t\t\t\t<li>Document BOOKED: Change level\
    \ from TRANSFER to BOOKED</li>\t\t\t</dir>\t\t<p></p><p>All SP screens are used\
    \ for four different purposes based on Financial Code:<dir>\t\t\t\t<li>\t\t\t\t\
    \t<strong>Sales:</strong>    This is sales of different hydrocarbons.</li>\t\t\
    \t\t<li>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Purchases:</strong>    This is purchases of different\
    \ hydrocarbons.</li>\t\t\t\t<li>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tariff Income:</strong>    This\

    \t\t\t<li>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tariff Cost:</strong>    This is costs/purchases from\
    \ use of pipeline capacity or any other service.</li>\t\t\t</dir>\t\t<p></p><p>\
    \    The different financial codes are: SALE used for sales, PURCHASE used for\
    \ purchases, TA_INCOME used for tariff income and TA_COST used for tariff cost.\
