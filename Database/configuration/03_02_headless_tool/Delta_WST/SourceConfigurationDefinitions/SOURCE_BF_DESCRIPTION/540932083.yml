  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to enter and view sub daily capacity restriction on operational restriction.</p><p>An operation object can be objects like PIPELINE and DELIVERY_POINT. The objects where an implementation needs capacity, the object must implement the OPERATIONAL_RESTRICTION interface.</p><p>Capacity restrictions can happen, either due to planned or unplanned events. This information is needed by the scheduling process for balancing the contracts against the allowable physical limitations of the pipeline.</p><p>By selecting an object in the navigator the restriction for selected date will be listed. A new restriction can be entered by pressing the insert button.</p><p>Note that restriction can be calculated based on other restrictions and the output from capacity calculation can be viewed here. The calculation can be customized in user exit package. When it is modified, the calculation defined in the user exit package will override the product calculation on capacity restrictions.</p>
