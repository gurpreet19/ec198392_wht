  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to run the forecast monthly sales calculations. The user selects the month for which the calculations are to be run, it could be a single month with only To Month parameter, or a range of From Month and To Month for multiple months. A list of previous runs&nbsp;of the calculations for the selected month and calculation job are displayed (if there are any) and the user can press the &quot;Run Forecast Monthly Sale Calculations&quot;&nbsp;button to invoke the calculations. All started calculations will show in the Running jobs (data section 1), several calculations may run simultaneously, but only one for&nbsp;each calculation job. The user could also have specified on the minute when to start the calculation, if it was not to start immediately. The Job Start Time is not&nbsp;mandatory to fill in.</p><p>Once a calculation run has been made, the details are displayed in new rows on the screen, one for each run, along with the outcome (e.g. Success of Failure). By&nbsp;highlighting a row from the upper section (data section 2) of the screen, i.e. an individual calculation run, the associated log file summary from that run is displayed in&nbsp;the lower section (data section 3) of the screen and the user can press the Download button to examine the full log file.</p><p>The Calculation Job makes it possible to decide how the calculations will be performed, if several jobs exist then they will run the calculations with different input&nbsp;parameters. These input parameters can be used by the calculation rules to decide which equations to execute.</p><p>The &quot;Simulate&quot; tick box may be used to run the calculations and inspect the subsequent log file, but without writing any results back to the database.</p><p>All successful runs may be approved. When a monthly run has been approved, it is no longer possible to run a monthly calculation for that month. Only users with&nbsp;access to approved data may change the Approval Status back to Provisional in order to run a new calculation.</p>
