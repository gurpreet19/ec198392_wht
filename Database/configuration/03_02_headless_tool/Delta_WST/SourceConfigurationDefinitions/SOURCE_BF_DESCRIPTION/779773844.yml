  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to display, update or add general prices for a product.</p><p>The normal process is to calculate the general product prices by the EC calculation engine, typically based on price indices. This would typically be a scheduled job,&nbsp;or can be initiated from the Price Calculation (PR.0008) business function. The calculated prices can be adjusted in the &ldquo;Adjusted Price&rdquo; column. The price value&nbsp;available externally (reporting, EC Revenue, etc) will be &ldquo;Adjusted Price&rdquo; if this is available, else it will be &ldquo;Calculated Price&rdquo;.</p><p>If prices are not calculated by the EC calculation engine, this business function also supports manual insert of prices.</p><p>The user selects the required month and an object in the navigator. All prices that are valid at the start of the month and throughout the month for the selected object&nbsp;will be listed. The last valid price from an earlier month will also be listed if there is no valid price on the first day of the month. Some price objects can appear more&nbsp;than once in a month if the prices have been calculated more than once.</p><p>Prices for individual contracts can not be added here, the business function Contract Price List (PR.0004) should be used together with Price Calculation (PR.0008).</p><p>For details about Price Object, Price Concept and Price Element, please read the EC Sales Configuration Manual.</p>
