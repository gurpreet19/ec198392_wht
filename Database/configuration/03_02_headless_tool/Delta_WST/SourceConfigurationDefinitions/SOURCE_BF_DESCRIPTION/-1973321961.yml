  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Report Document Setup screen</strong>    is used to
    connect specific Report Templates to the Document Templates that    exist in the
    EC Revenue configuration.</p><p><u>    The screen is divided into these sections:
    </u><br>    <strong><em>- Document Template Section</em></strong><br>    It shows
    existing Document Templates defined in Document Template screen    (BF CD.0013).<br>
    <br>    <strong><em> - Report Template Section</em></strong><br>    The section
    contains Reports available for the chosen Document Template.<br>More Reports can
    be added and versioned. Here we can choose what action needs to be perfomed when
    the document is moved from one validation level to another.<br>For eg: If we choose
    ''Generate Report'' in&nbsp;''Open to valid 1 Action'' dropdown, then everytime
    when the document is moved from ''Open'' to ''Valid1'', the report will be generated.<br><br>Following
    are the 4 options that can be chosen in the dropdowns:</p><ul><li><b>Generate
    Report:</b> The report will be generated, if missing. Will not be regenerated
    if already generated.</li>  <li><b>Delete Report:</b>&nbsp;The report will be
    deleted.</li>  <li><b>Regenerate Report:</b> The report will be regenerated, if
    it is already generated. Otherwise the report will be generated.</li>  <li><b>No
    Action: </b>No action will be performed.</li></ul><p></p><p>Report Templates are
    defined in Report Template screen (BF RP.0001).<br>Configured templates will then
    be available in the    <em>Select Document Setup</em> popup for selecting a report
    to run in the Document General screen (BF SP.0016).</p>'
