    can be added and versioned. Moreover, here the user can choose what action needs
    to be performed when the document is moved from one validation level to another.</p><p>For
    eg: If we choose ''Generate Report'' in&nbsp;''Open to valid 1 Action'' dropdown,
    then everytime when the document is moved from ''Open'' to ''Valid1'', the report
    will be generated.</p><p>Following are 4 options that can be chosen in the dropdowns:</p><ul><li><strong>Generate
    Report:</strong> The report will be generated, if missing. Will not be regenerated
    if already generated.</li><li><strong>Delete Report:</strong>&nbsp;The report
    will be deleted.</li><li><strong>Regenerate Report:</strong> The report will be
    regenerated, if it is already generated. Otherwise the report will be generated.</li><li><strong>No
    Action: </strong>No action will be performed.</li></ul><p>Report Templates are
    defined in Report Template screen (BF RP.0001).</p><p>Configured templates will
    then be available in the <em>Select Document Setup</em> popup for selecting a
    report to run in the Document General screen (BF SP.0016).</p>'
