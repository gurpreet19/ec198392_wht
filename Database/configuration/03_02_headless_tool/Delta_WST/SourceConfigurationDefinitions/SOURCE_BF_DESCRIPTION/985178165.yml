  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to enter mass batch exports including loading onto rail cars. After a batch is loaded onto rail cars, the rail cars may be stored away waiting for a customer or available export slot. When physical exported, the final export date is entered.</p>

    <p>The loaded volume can be treated as part of the storage between transfer daytime and export date. This must be done as a &quot;user exit&quot; derived stream which returns total volume loaded but not exported for a day.</p>

    <p>Ticket mass is the official number being used by functions in EC. Default is that the ticket number is equal the calculated loaded number. It can be overwritten.</p>
