  DESCRIPTION: '<p style="font-size: 13.3333px;">The business function for "Production
    Test Define" displays all&nbsp;<em>production tests&nbsp;</em>registered in the
    system that satisfies the navigation criteria, and at the same time enables the
    operator to introduce new tests.</p><p style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Many times,
    the metering setup of the test device involves choosing between multiple alternative&nbsp;metrs&nbsp;for
    oil, gas, and water. In a situation where standard, adjusted rates are to be calculated
    on the fly for each test sample (e.g. at a 5-minute interval in PT.0006), the
    correct selection of preferred meters must be carried out as a part of the test
    definition. The PT.0005 business function provides the necessary tools for defining
    these primary meters and also tools to redefine them in cases where the initial
    selection turned out to be inadequate.</p><p style="font-size: 13.3333px;">PT.0005
    - Production Test Define is the starting point for the performance test work process
    in EC. Data entered here will propagate and influence the data presented in all
    other downstream PT business functions. The business function contains a&nbsp;<em>navigator
    section&nbsp;</em>and three&nbsp;<em>data sections</em>. All data sections are
    visible at the same time.</p><p style="font-size: 13.3333px;">The&nbsp;<strong>navigator&nbsp;</strong>section
    enables the selection of a time window (from date - to date). There must be an
    overlap between the navigator From-To and the Start-End time interval of the&nbsp;<em>production
    test measurement data set&nbsp;</em>for the test to be listed. From Date &lt;
    End Date AND To Date &gt; Start Date. The to-date is configurable by&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;user
    settings screen (CO.1008) which by default is set to TODAY. The navigator is based
    on the configured group model down to the well level. The&nbsp;well&nbsp;element
    is optional. If provided, the production test data set must contain the selected
    well as an active well and also have a defined instrumentation type in order to
    be listed. The&nbsp;<em>Test No&nbsp;</em>element is optional. If provided, navigation
    will select one specific performance test.</p><p style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Navigator
    selections are applied when pressing the [GO] -button.</p><p style="font-size:
    13.3333px;"><strong>Data section 1&nbsp;</strong>lists all&nbsp;production test
    measurement data sets&nbsp;that satisfy the navigation criteria. Records are sorted
    descending on Start Date (most recent on top). The list is scrollable and supports
    single record selection. Collapse/expand functionality is activated. The selected
    record in this data section controls the content of the data sections 2, 3 and
    4. The initial focus is the top row in the data section. The&nbsp;End Date&nbsp;and&nbsp;Comment&nbsp;fields
    are editable data elements in&nbsp;Data section 1&nbsp;when retrieving. When inserting,<span
    style="font-size: 13.3333px;">&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Start Date</span>&nbsp;will
    always be the current date and time</span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">&nbsp;by&nbsp;default.</span><span
    style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Start Date&nbsp;</span><span
    style="font-size: 10pt;">and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Test Type&nbsp;</span><span
    style="font-size: 10pt;">are also opened for edit so that all initial information
    necessary for creating a performance test can be supplied.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:
    10pt;">Start Date&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and&nbsp;</span><span
    style="font-size: 10pt;">Test Type&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are
    mandatory entries, whereas&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">End Date&nbsp;</span><span
    style="font-size: 10pt;">is optional. This supports a situation where test operators
    insert live tests (End Date not known).</span></p><p>While inserting a record
    for a Production Test, the default value for Test Device will be selected as mentioned
    in the following order:</p><ol><li>If a well has a defined test device, then that
    test device will be selected automatically.</li><li>If facility has a default
    test device, then that device will be selected automatically.</li><li>If facility
    has only one test device, then that device will be selected automatically.</li></ol><p>If
    all above conditions do not meet, no default test device will be selected.</p>'
