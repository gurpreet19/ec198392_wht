  DESCRIPTION: "<p>\t<strong>Inventory Transfer screen</strong>    is used to handle\
    \ the Inventory Level change from VALID2 to TRANSFER or to OPEN.<br>    - The\
    \ Static Navigator selection determines which Inventories to list in the screen.\
    \ If the Inventory Level selector has been set to VALID2 the system will    list\
    \ Inventories at this level and the user can change Inventory Level for an Inventory\
    \ by ticking the appropriate level tick box followed by a Save    operation. More\
    \ than one Inventory can be ticked before saving.<br>    - When setting the Inventory\
    \ Level selector in the Static Navigator to any other value than VALID2 the user\
    \ can view Inventories having other Inventory    Levels. In this case it is not\
    \ possible to change level for any Inventory.<br>     - In order to use this screen,\
    \ the user needs to set the system attribute INV_4EYE_VALIDATION = \"Y\". This\
    \ is to indicate whether to have 5-level / 2-user validation    for Inventory\
    \ or not, Options are Y | N.</p>\t\t\t<strong>Button <span style=\"color: rgb(0,\
    \ 153, 0);\">Toggle Tick Boxes</span>\t\t\t</strong>    toggles all the \"Set\
    \ to TRANSFER\" tick boxes. This screen will by default have Inventory Level set\
    \ to VALID2 in the Static Navigator.<p></p>\t\t\t<p>\t\t\t\t<u>This screen is\
    \ divided into three sections:</u>\t\t\t\t<br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t<em>-\

    \ in 5 steps by 2 users.<br>    The Inventory Level follows a level hierarchy\
    \ as follows: <span style=\"color: rgb(204, 0, 0);\">OPEN - VALID 1 - VALID 2\
