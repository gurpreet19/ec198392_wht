  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The Deferment Day screen (PD.0023) is a simplified deferment screen
    used to manage deferment events caused by the registered asset.</p><p>This BF
    supports adjusting the volume and mass loss quantities for each production day
    independently for the reported deferment event. Only single events are supported
    in this business function. Both operational and collection point group models
    are supported.</p><p>Deferment Day has two data sections:</p><p>Deferment Event:
    To capture overall date and time of the event, event type, scheduled event, selected
    object type, name and its active phase, linked event or equipment, the enabled
    4 reason(s) attribute for the event, the not editable event loss quantities which
    are the function attributes to display the related sum-up daily Loss quantities.
    User is able to insert, update and delete events in this section. Object Types
    are populated based on the group model. Example is as below :</p><div class="ui-widget"><div
    class="ui-datatable-tablewrapper"><table role="grid" cellpadding="10"><thead><tr
    role="row"><th width="350" class="ui-state-default" role="columnheader" aria-label="Group"
    scope="col"><span><center>Group Model Type</center></span></th><th class="ui-state-default"
    role="columnheader" aria-label="Object" scope="col"><span><center>Available Object
    Types</center></span></th></tr></thead><tbody class="ui-datatable-data ui-widget-content"><tr
    class="ui-widget-content ui-datatable-even" role="row"><td role="gridcell"><span>Operational</span></td><td
    role="gridcell" colspan="2"><span>Facility Class 1, Well Hookup, Well, Equipment
    and Tank.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Collection Point</span></td><td role="gridcell"><span>Operator
    Route, Collection Point, Well, Equipment and Tank.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Deleting
    the parent record, it will delete the related child deferment day records and
    no prompt to user on the deletion on the Deferment Event. However, there is a
    screen alert message to inform the user when updating the ''Start Daytime'' or
    ''End Daytime'' will result in deletion of all related deferment day records when
    the modified start Daytime is after the original start Daytime and it is more
    than a day. And the similar logic applied on the modified end Daytime to check
    before the original end Daytime.</p><p>This BF allows future Deferment Event with
    start and end daytime which is after current production day, and it will populate
    the child deferment day records based on the closed event. There is a class trigger
    action which can be enabled to prevent the future Deferment Event entry.</p><p>Tab
    1 : Deferment Day: To capture data for daily loss quantities based on date range
    entered at its parent data-section. Insertion or deletion of records in Deferment
    day data is automatically handled based on start daytime and end daytime of the
    parent event. For open event, data is generated until current valid production
    day when the start Daytime is before or on the current Production Day. However,
    no record will be generated for the open event with the start Daytime after the
    current Production Day. Instantiation process can also automatically generate
    new deferment day records for open event and loss quantities will be copied from
    the previous day. The entered daily loss quantities for volume and mass for each
    deferment day record will be aggregated and summed up immediately to update the
    event loss quantities attributes at the parent Deferment Event after saving the
    entries. Deferment day records will be sorted in descending order.</p><p>Tab 2
    : Graphical View: The graphical view will show the daily loss quantity for the
    selected production phase for the span of the event.</p><div class="ui-widget-header
