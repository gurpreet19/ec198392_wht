  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual for more details.</p>

    <p>Chemical Tank is a tank having a Chemical Product (see CO.0072 - Chemical Product). Chemical Tanks are different from Tanks and these to classes must not be mixed. Chemical Tanks cannot have produced products and they cannot be included in Storages as Tanks can be.</p>

    <p>Chemical Tanks have different units to determine closing inventory. See attribute TANK_CLOSING_UOM for details.</p>

    <p>Consumption is calculated as yesterday closing - today closing + filled. If there is no closing inventory today, EC will interpolate between two nearest days. If there is no future closing, EC will use the daily consumption rate configured to estimate a closing inventory. See attributes for more details.</p>

    <p>The unit of measure used for the tank is configurable. Chemical Tanks can also have different Chemical Products assigned, date effective.</p>
