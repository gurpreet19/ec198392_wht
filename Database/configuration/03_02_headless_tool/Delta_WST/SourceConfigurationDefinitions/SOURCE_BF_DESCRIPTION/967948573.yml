  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The purpose of the Excel Report Context is to represent a set of
    data to be used by a report. An Excel report can be switched between similar contexts,
    allowing for a high level filtering on the data (although not very flexible).
    The report context is used in either Excel Report Objects or Excel report Sets
    business functions. </p><p><br></p><p>For example: You can create an individual
    Context for each Contract, or one Context with all Contracts filtered by another
    Parameter.</p>'
