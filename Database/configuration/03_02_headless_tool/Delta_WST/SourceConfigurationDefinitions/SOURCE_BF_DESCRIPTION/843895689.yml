  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function enables registration of inlet gas quantities by process train. The business function also calculates the planned production rundown into related&nbsp;product storages based on a set of process train storage yield factors. These factors are process train specific and must be configured in the Process Train Storage&nbsp;Yield Factor business function. A yield factors is a ratio indicating how much of a specific product that can be obtained from the amount of inlet gas feeding into the&nbsp;process train&rsquo;s liquefaction and purification process.</p><p>The first data section allows insert of inlet gas quantities by process trains for a period of time. The second data section is a read-only section calculating the<br />planned production rundown based on process train storage yield factors.</p>
