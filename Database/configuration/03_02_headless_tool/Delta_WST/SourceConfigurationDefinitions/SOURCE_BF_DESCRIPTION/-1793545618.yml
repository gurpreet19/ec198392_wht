  DESCRIPTION: <p>The Integration Services captures data from external source systems (e.g. PI, OPC HDA, Oracle JDBC) and transfers it to the EC database for permanent storage. Configuration of data capture is done in mappings. A mapping defines which tag to be read and where to store the result, but there are also a lot of parameters to define which read method is to be used (if multiple are supported by the source system), which calculations are performed between the source system and EC, how to handle timestamps, etc.</p><p>A mapping is defined by linking a tag name with a storage location in EC, and selecting an appropriate mapping template (which defines how to read and write the tag). The available templates are defined in the Maintain Templates screen, and the mappings are defined in Maintain Mappings.</p>
