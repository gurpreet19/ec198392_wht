  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to keep track of a daily average pressure and temperature registration on pipelines. All pipelines that have been configured with the &quot;Include In Screen&quot; &ndash; flag in the Create and Maintain Pipeline screens will be listed. Energy Components creates one new record for each item of pipeline for a production day through an automatic instantiation process. Thus, insertion and deletion is not possible from the screen. The pipeline must be associated with a facility in order to be available for navigation. This association is handled in the Pipeline create/maintain screen.</p>
