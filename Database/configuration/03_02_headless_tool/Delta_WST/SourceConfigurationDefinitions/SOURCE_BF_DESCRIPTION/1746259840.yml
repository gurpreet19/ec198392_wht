  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>

    <p>The meter run is the physical pipe assembly that the orifice plate is mounted in. AGA 3 specifies various parameters relating to length, mounting position etc.</p>

    <p>Although a meter run is in fact fixed to a separator, well flow line or facility stream, to reduce the data configuration overhead for the user, meter runs are created as &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; objects which are referenced by a separator, conduit or stream. This allows for where similar runs are installed, a single run of that size may be configured only once and referenced by many separators, conduits or streams.</p>
