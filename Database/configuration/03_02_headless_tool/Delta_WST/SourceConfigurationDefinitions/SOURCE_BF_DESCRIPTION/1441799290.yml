  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to list steam injection well status data for a Period (From &ndash; To Date) and for only one well. The well is directly connected to a facility, without any intermediate flowline / pipeline systems that needs to be taken into account.</p>

    <p>Data can be entered manually or automatically. The BF requires one entry per well per day, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all active steam injection wells. In addition, the injection well is recognized by having attribute WELL_CLASS set to &lsquo;I&rsquo; (Injector) or &lsquo;PI&rsquo; (Producer and Injector). Only wells having the attribute WELL_TYPE set to &lsquo;SI&rsquo; (steam injector) will appear in this screen.</p>

    <p>This BF is actually a variant of the WR.0029 - Daily Steam Injection Well Status, but with a different navigator type to display the records for a well throughout a period. It will have reference to the WR.0029, and the values for both BF should match.</p>

    <p>V_IWEL_DAY_STATUS view is available and it shows the injection data for any kind of injection well in a single view.</p>
