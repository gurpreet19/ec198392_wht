  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Transaction Quantities screen</strong>    handles the
    Hydrocarbon Quantities for each Transaction for a Document. These quantities will
    be used by the Hydrocarbon Quantity-based Line Items where    the financial value
    is calculated by Hydrocarbon Quantity times a Unit Price.</p><p>    <strong>Each
    transaction can hold four sets of quantities:</strong><br>    1. Net Quantities
    for the current transaction.<br>    2. Gross Quantities for the current transaction<br>    3.
    Preceding Net Quantities copied from a corresponding transaction from a preceding
    Document / Transaction. These quantities will be NULL if there is no    Preceding
    Document for the Document. Preceding Document / Transaction quantities are typically
    used together with two-step invoicing where the sales    quantity changes from
    the first step (Provisional Invoice) to the second step (Final Invoice) and the
    Final Invoice need to show both the initial quantity    and the final quantity.<br>    4.
    Preceding Gross Quantities copied from a corresponding transaction from a preceding
    Document / Transaction. These quantities will be NULL if there is no    Preceding
    Document for the Document.</p><p>    Normally only the Net quantities are in use
    as the Gross quantities are mainly for handling Crude quantities where the Gross
    quantity includes the water in    the oil and the Net quantities are without water.
    Each set of quantities can hold up to 4 Units of Measure (UOM) as defined by the
    Contract.</p><p>    <strong>The rules for enabling / disabling the various quantity
    entry fields are as follows:</strong><br>    - All quantity entry fields are protected
    if the Document Level of the Document is set to VALID1, VALID2, TRANSFER, or BOOKED.<br>    -
    All the Preceding quantity fields are always protected.<br>    - The NET QTY quantity
    entry fields are protected if there are no Line Items for the Transaction where
    the Net/Gross indicator is set to NET_CURRENT.<br>    - The GROSS QTY quantity
    entry fields are protected if there are no Line Items for the Transaction where
    the Net/Gross indicator is set to GROSS_CURRENT.<br>    - The NET QTY / GROSS
    QTY quantity entry fields are only enabled for those UOMs which are defined at
    the Contract.</p><p>    <strong>Supply Period Logic:</strong><br>    Period based
    sales quantities can be interfaced into EC Revenue and will then be stored in
    a Contract Quantities Interface Table (STIM_MTH_CONTRACT_VALUE).    When setting
    the <em>Supply From</em> date and <em>Supply To</em> date and these dates matches
    a complete month the system will look into the Contract    Quantities Interface
    Table to see if there are any sales quantity data available matching the Product,
    Price Concept, and Delivery Point of the current    Transaction. If any such is
    found, the sales quantity will be copied to the Transaction and the record in
    the Contract Quantities Interface Table will be    marked as used by this Transaction.
    If not found, the next step is to look into the VO monthly table to pick up VO
    quantities for the Stream Item defined    for the Transaction. If there are any
    quantities not used by any other Sales document, the quantities are copied to
    the Transaction and at the same time    the Calculation Method is set to <em>SP</em>
    for the Stream Item in VO. The quantity is also set to NULL in VO. When the document
    is set to BOOKED the    Transaction quantity will be moved back into VO.</p><p>    <strong>Accrual
    Logic:</strong><br>For ACCRUAL type of Documents it is also possible to pick quantities
    from VO based on a number of Daily quantities added together by selecting    <em>Accrual
    quantities based on x days of VO quantities</em> in the popup for the UOM1 quantity.</p><p>    <strong>Use
    of quantities:</strong><br>    The quantities will be copied to the Quantity based
    Line Items when saving. The quantity copied to the Line Item will be multiplied
    with the Line Item    Contribution Factor. The Contribution Factor is a factor
    defined at the Price Element level Trigger logic at the Line Item Table (CONT_LINE_ITEM)
    will    recalculate the value of the Line Items whenever there is a change in
    the UOM1 quantity. The quantities will also be converted to all the different
    UOM    sub-groups and saved in the CONT_LINE_ITEM_UOM table. See <em>Conversion
    to all UOM sub-groups</em> sub-section for details on which UOMs the quantities    are
    converted to.</p><p>    <strong>The screen is divided into these sections:</strong><br>    <strong><em>-
    Filter Navigator:</em></strong><br>    The Filter Navigator lists all the contracts
    being valid at the date selected in the Filter Navigator. By clicking a contract
    object in the Filter    Navigator all the Documents already created will be listed
    in the Document List section.<br>    <strong><em>- Document List:</em></strong><br>    The
    Document List section lists all the documents created for the selected contract.
    By clicking a Document the Transaction List will be populated with the    Transactions
    for the selected Document. The first Document will be selected by default.<br>    <strong><em>-
    Transaction List:</em></strong><br>    This section lists the Transactions for
    the selected Document. By clicking a Transaction the Quantity details will be
    listed in the Quantity Details    section.<br>    <strong><em>- Quantity Details:</em></strong><br>    This
    section lists the four sets of quantities for the Transaction.</p><p>    <strong>Conversion
    to all UOM sub-groups:</strong><br>    The Transaction Net Quantity numbers are
    converted for reporting purposes to all UOM sub-groups using standard conversion
    factors and/or inter-group    conversion factors. Conversions will not take place
    if there are no conversion factors available. In this case the number will be
    set to NULL in the    CONT_TRANSACTION_UOM table.</p><p>    <strong>The conversion
    is done to the following units:</strong><br>    - Joule: 100MJ<br>    - British
    Therms: THERMS<br>    - Watt Hours: KWH<br>    - Mass in Air: MT<br>    - Mass
    in Vacuum: MTV<br>    - Mass in US Tonnes in Air: UST<br>    - Mass in US Tonnes
    in Vacuum: USTV<br>    - Barrels Imperial: BBLS60<br>    - Barrels Metric: BBLS15<br>    -
