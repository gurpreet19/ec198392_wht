  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This screen is used to record the duration and the reason(s) when
    the equipment is unavailable. This is useful to improve reliability and reporting
    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). If more than one equipment involved in the
    same incident, that equipment can be connected in a group equipment downtime event.</p><p>This
    business function is used to record following events.</p><ul style="list-style-type:
    disc; margin-left: 40px;"><li>A single equipment downtime event.</li><li>A group
    equipment downtime event, several of equipment attached to the group as child
    records.</li></ul><p>A single or group equipment downtime event can be associated
    with a Master Event. It helps the user to logically group together following events
    from different event screens with the corresponding Master Event:<ul style="list-style-type:
    disc; margin-left: 40px;"><li>Deferment (PD.0020)</li><li>Deferment Day (PD.0023)</li><li>Equipment
    Downtime (PD.0022)</li><li>Environmental Events (PO.0009)</li></ul><br>For example,
    if a hurricane passes through a facility, the user would create a "Hurricane"
    Master Event. This Master Event can then be associated with the single or group
    equipment downtime event. The Master Event ID is a system generated unique code
    that is made up of a 5 digit code plus a year, month and day, plus a sequence
    number.</p><p>Equipment can be added to the event group by using the ''Move to
    Group'' button or by inserting new equipment in the ''Equipment in Group'' section.</p><p>No
    overlapping events are allowed in the Equipment Downtime business function.</p><div
