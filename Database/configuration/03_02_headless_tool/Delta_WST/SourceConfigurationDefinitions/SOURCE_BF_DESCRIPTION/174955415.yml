  DESCRIPTION: <p>    <strong>Account Mapping screen</strong>    is used by the system to find the correct Accounts for the ERP posting    based on a set of selection data.</p><p>    The concept is using a <em>best match</em> approach where EC tries to find    the Account Mapping that fits best based on the selection criteria.    <br> Technically this is done by executing a SQL query and then ordering the    result set from <em>best match</em> to <em>poorest match</em>. <br> EC will    execute the Account Mapping lookup for the Credit and the Debit posting    separately.</p>
