  DESCRIPTION: <p>This is a configuration screen for Product Measurement for each product. The setup is used to instantiate Storage Lifting used in BL/MR Info screen. This<br />instantiation takes place when changing the cargo status from Tentative to Official. I.e. adding new units for cargoes with status set to Official will not reflect these&nbsp;modifications.</p><p>One of the Product Measurement Units must be selected as nomination unit. This unit will be reflected in all screens where you have a quantity. The selected&nbsp;nomination unit for a given product should not be updated after the measurement settings have been taken into action. Such a change will affect all historical data.&nbsp;Nominated unit indicator must be the same on &lsquo;Load&rsquo; and &lsquo;Unload&rsquo;.</p><p>The calculated attribute will make the measurement item protected in either BL/Mr Info or Unload Info depending on the lifting event. A calculate button can be used&nbsp;to set the values in those business functions.</p><p>The attribute &lsquo;Mapping to Revenue&rsquo; is by default disabled, but if integration with EC Revenue is required. It identifies what units should be available in EC Revenue.&nbsp;If both net and gross values are used they should be connected to the same mapping code. Meaning Net Mass is connected to Qty 1 and Gross Mass is connected&nbsp;to Qty 1. It is important that the unit is the same if a mapping is set on two items. Qty 1 is mandatory.</p>
