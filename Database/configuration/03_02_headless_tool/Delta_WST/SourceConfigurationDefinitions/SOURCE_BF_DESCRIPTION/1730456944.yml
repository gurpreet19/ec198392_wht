  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This BF will be used for liquid streams where there is a totalizer
    installed. Volume Correction Factor (VCF) is also calculated in this business
    function to obtain the Calculated Gross Volume at Standard Condition. The VCF
    procedure is developed based on the Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards
    Chapter 11, Addendum 1, September 2007.</p><p>The observed gravity, temperature
    and pressure are used to call the API calculation to determine the Corrected Gravity
    and Volume Correction Factor (VCF). In this API procedure, the temperature to
    calculate the VCF will first consider the &quot;Run Temp&quot;. If this is null,
    it will look for &quot;Observed Temp&quot;. One of these temperature values will
    then be used to calculate the VCF (referred to as VCF Temp).</p><p>The VCF calculation
    will first calculate the Corrected Gravity by taking the Observed Gravity, Observed
    Temp and Observed Pressure. Then, it will use the calculated Corrected Gravity
    together with VCF Temp and Observed Pressure to determine the VCF.</p><p>This
    scenario has been tested against the API Standards Chapter 11.1.6. Below are the
    accepted units which can be used in EC for VCF calculation:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Temperature
    - Celsius or Fahrenheit</li><li>Pressure - any unit as the procedure will convert
    it to PSIG</li></ul><p>The following user input is tested according to API Standards
    Chapter 11.1.6.1.2:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Observed
    Temperature (&deg;F)</li><li>Observed Pressure</li><li>Observed Gravity</li></ul><p>Test
    scenarios above are based on the scenarios defined in the Standards.</p><p>Copy
    forward of override factors can be disabled in CO.1006 - Maintain System Settings
    screen, under Custom Settings -> Period Totalizer Screens: Disable copy forward
    for override factors property.</p>'
