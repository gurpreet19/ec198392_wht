  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Transaction Distribution Setup</strong>    defines
    the default distribution of transaction quantities and monetary values to Fields
    for those transactions that handles revenue/cost of quantities    coming from
    more than one Field, i.e. Field-Group type of Contracts. At Contract level the
    user selects whether to use Transaction Distribution or not, as    well as whether
    to distribute against Fields. For each Transaction Template using the distribution
    functionality the user defines whether to use    Percentage-based distribution
    or Source Split -based distribution.</p><p>    The distribution is defined as
    a Split Key where the split key members are Field stream items and there is a
    percentage for each of the participating    stream items. The user defines the
    participating Fields stream items as well as the percentage for each.</p><p>    The
    default distribution defined for each Transaction Template will be copied to the
    Document / Transaction when processing the Contract / Document. The    distribution
    can be changed for each particular Document / Transaction, including adding/removing
    Field stream items and also changing the split percentage    values. The split
    percentage values can be manipulated directly or they can be generated by the
    system based on values such as allocated quantities. The    allocated quantities
    can be entered manually by the user or uploaded from interfaced data.</p><p>    <strong><em>As
    an example</em></strong>    , assume there is a crude lifting where the total
    cargo quantity is 200 000 BBLS and the revenue is 8 000 000 USD. If the crude
    is produced by a number of    Fields, then the quantities and revenue can be allocated
    to each Field based on a split key. The split key will then define the Fields
    taking part in the    delivery.</p><p>    Assume the 200 000 BBLS have been delivered
    from the following Fields with allocated quantities as follows:<br>    Field A:
    120 000 BBLS <br>    Field B: 60 000 BBLS <br>    Field C: 20 000 BBLS <br></p><p>    Assume
    the transaction uses Percentage Split, this will then give a percentage split
    per Field as follows:<br>    Field A: 60.000 %<br>    Field B: 30.000 %<br>    Field
    C: 10.000 %&nbsp;</p><p>    and the revenue will then be allocated to Fields accordingly:<br>    Field
    A: 60.000 % X 8 000 000 USD = 4 800 000 USD<br>    Field B: 30.000 % X 8 000 000
    USD = 2 400 000 USD<br>    Field C: 10.000 % X 8 000 000 USD = 800 000 USD</p><p>    The
    distribution to Fields may not be final at the time of invoicing the customer.
    Due to this EC Revenue supports Redistribution of the invoiced amount.    Redistribution
    will redistribute the quantities and revenue to a different set of Fields based
    on a new split key. The new split key can have new Fields    compared to the previous
    one.</p><p>    The Transaction Distribution can also be Source Split based. In
    this case the distribution will be based on other stream items values, for instance
    can the    sales quantities be distributed according to production quantities.</p><p>    <strong><em>As
    an example</em></strong>    , assume there is a gas sale where the total gas sale
    quantity is 200 000 MJ and the revenue is 8 000 000 USD. Assume the gas is produced
    by a number of    Fields, then the quantities and revenue can be allocated to
    each Field based on the production from each field. The split key will then define
    both the    stream items to allocate to as well as which stream items to pick
    the production quantities from.</p><p>    Assume the 200 000 MJ have been delivered
    from the Fields A, B and C and the production quantities are as follows:<br>    Field
    A Production: 132 000 MJ<br>    Field B Production: 66 000 MJ<br>    Field C Production:
    22 000 MJ<br>    (Production quantity a bit higher than sales quantity due to
    fuel/flare)</p><p>    The production quantities will then be used to calculate
    a percentage split to be used for allocating the sales quantity to Assume the
    transaction uses    Percentage Split, this will then give a percentage split per
    Field as follows:</p><p>    Field A Sales: 60.000 % -&gt; 120 000 MJ<br>    Field
    B Sales: 30.000 % -&gt; 60 000 MJ<br>    Field C Sales: 10.000 % -&gt; 20 000
    MJ&nbsp;</p><p>    and the revenue will then be allocated to Fields accordingly:<br>    Field
    A: 60.000 % X 8 000 000 USD = 4 800 000 USD<br>    Field B: 30.000 % X 8 000 000
    USD = 2 400 000 USD<br>    Field C: 10.000 % X 8 000 000 USD = 800 000 USD</p><p>    This
    type of distribution is very powerful as it is dynamic and the percentage split
    will change according to other quantities, such as production.</p><p>    <strong>The
    screen is divided into these sections:</strong><br>    <strong><em> - Filter Navigator:</em></strong><br>    The
    Filter Navigator lists all the contracts being valid at the date selected in the
    Filter Navigator and having the Use Distribution flag set    (CONTRACT.USE_DISTRIBUTION
    = Y). By clicking a contract object in the Filter Navigator all the Document Setups
    defined for the Contract will be listed in    the Document Setup List section.<br>    <strong><em>-
    Document Setup List:</em></strong><br>    The Document Setup List section lists
    all the document setups defined for the selected contract. By clicking a Document
    Setup the Transaction templates    defined for that Document Setup will be listed
    in the Transaction Template List section.<br>    <strong><em>- Transaction Template
    List:</em></strong><br>    This section will list all Transaction Templates for
    the selected Document Setup. By clicking a Transaction Template the Stream Items
    taking part in the    Transaction Distribution will be listed in the Transaction
    Distribution Setup Details section.<br>    <strong><em>- Stream Item Selector:</em></strong><br>    From
    this section the user can select which Field Stream Items to include in the Transaction
    Distribution Setup by selecting Field specific Stream Items.<br>    <strong><em>-
    Transaction Distribution Setup Details:</em></strong><br>    This section lists
    all the Stream Items taking part in the Transaction Distribution Setup. Here the
    user defines the default split between the different    Stream Items for Percentage
    type of distribution.</p>'
