  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Royalty Reconciliation screen</strong>    is used to
    reconcile the difference between two Royalty Runs. Two Royalty Runs can be chosen
    based on preceding document, previous accrual document or End of Period documents
    (EOPs). <br> This functionality will only consider the calculation cycles which
    are run after setting the system attribute -    <strong>ENABLE_DOC_TRACING</strong>
    as Y.</p><p>    The screen will first identify the other royalty run document
    based on the comparison type provided, and then it will figure out the corresponding
    Extract Documents to compare to. <br> The screen further provides the opportunity
    to compare further at more detailed levels by choosing which to    analyze more.
    </p><h3>    <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Navigator</strong></h3><p>    The
    purpose of Navigator is to filter out the 2 documents to be compared.</p><p><u>Navigator
    has following elements:</u><br>    <strong>- Daytime: </strong>    This is the
    month for which the royalty calculations are run and reconciliation is to be done.<br>    This
    data element is mandatory.<br>    <strong>- Report: </strong>    Documents with
    the selected Dataset will be managed in the screen. This data element is mandatory.<br>    <strong>-
    Contract Area/Property: </strong>    Any documents belonging to a Contract linked
    to the selected Contract Area will be listed. This data element is mandatory.<br>    <strong>-
    Product Stream/Project: </strong>    Documents related to the selected Project
    will be managed in the screen. This data element is mandatory.<br>    <strong>-
    Document Key: </strong>    This contains the list of calculations ran, filtered
    on the previous parameters.<br>    <strong>- Compare Type: </strong>    The options
    available for this mandatory field is available in EC codes. There are three options:
    - To Preceding, To Accrual, and EOPS to Last    Month Report.<br>    1. To Preceding
    will give the last Calculation ran irrespective if the chosen and preceding are
    or are not the same type (Accrual/Actual).<br>    2. To Accrual will give the
    last Accrual Calculation Run with the same settings. This works for both Accrual
    and Actual.<br>    3. EOPs to Last Month Report will compare EOPs with the matching
    GFE / MRC from December.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0, 153,
