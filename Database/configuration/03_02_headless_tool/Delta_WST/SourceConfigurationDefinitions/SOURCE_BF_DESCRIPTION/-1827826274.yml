  DESCRIPTION: '<p>A deferment is an event that leads to production or injection not
    meeting the planned production or injection numbers. The Deferment screen (PD.0020)
    is used to enter and calculate deferment losses.</p><p>A deferment can affect
    one single well only or multiple wells. The deferment can lead to a full shut-in
    (Downtime deferment) of the well(s) or just a reduction (Constraint deferment)
    of the well(s) flow rate. Deferments are classified and categorized to be able
    to create reports explaining why production or injection plans were not met.</p><p>This
    BF is used to enter both downtime and constraint deferments as defined below:</p><ul
    style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;"><li>A Downtime deferment means
    that the production is shut-in, not only reduced.</li><li>A Constraint deferment
    means that the production is not shut-in, only reduced.</li></ul><p>''Deferment''
    data section will filter the records based on the selected navigator. Meanwhile,
    records in ''Wells in Group'' are showed based on the parent group. Navigator
    will only filter records in ''Deferment'' data section.</p><p>Both downtime and
    constraint deferments can be recorded against:</p><ul style="list-style-type:
    disc; margin-left: 40px;"><li><p><em>Single well only</em></p></li><li><p><em>Group
    events (Not well deferments)</em><br>These events are used where the constraints
    are not on the well, rather on the Facility, Well Hookup, Equipment, or Tank level.
    For such events, event losses will be calculated as mentioned below:</p><ul style="list-style-type:circle;margin-left:40px;"><li>If
    Loss Volume is null and Loss Rate is not null then Event Loss will be Loss Rate
    * Period for which deferment occurred.</li><li>If both Loss Rate and Loss Volume
    are not null then Event Loss will be equal to Loss Volume.</li></ul></li><li><p><em>Group</em><br>A
    set of well deferment events for a set of wells can be grouped using ''Parent''
    which are Facility, Well Hookup, Equipment, and Tank.</p></li></ul><div class="ui-widget-header

    table.</p><p>Event loss volume calculation for open ended event will be calculated
    until the current system date minus one. If there is any locked month within the
