  DESCRIPTION: '<p>PT.0019 - Injection Test Define is the starting point for the performance
    test work process in EC. Data defined in this business function will propagate
    and influence the data presented in all other downstream PT business functions.
    The business function contains a navigator section and three data sections. All
    data sections are visible at the same time.</p><p>The navigator section enables
    the selection of a time window (from date - to date). There must be an overlap
    between the navigator From-To and the Start-End time interval of the injection
    test measurement data set for the test to be listed. The navigator is based on
    the configured group model down to the well level. The well popup is optional
    and displays list of injection wells. only. If provided, the injection test data
    set must contain the selected well as an active well. The Test No element is optional.
    If provided, the test data in first data section will be filtered for mentioned
    Test No.</p><p>Data section 1 lists all injection test measurement data sets that
    satisfy the navigation criteria. Records are sorted descending on Start Date (most
    recent on top). The list is scrollable and supports single record selection. The
    selected record in this data section controls the content of the data sections
    2, 3, 4 and 5.During insert operation / event, Start Date will always be the current
    date and time by default. Start Date and Test Type are also opened for edit so
    that all initial information necessary for creating a performance test can be
    supplied. Start Date and Test Type are mandatory entries, whereas End Date is
    optional. This supports a situation where test operators insert live tests (End
    Date not known). Once a test has been saved in system, this data section will
    only allow updating of attributes "End Date" and "Comments".</p><p style="">While
    inserting a record for an Injection Test, the default value for Test Device will
    be selected as mentioned in the following order:</p><ul style="list-style-type:
    disc; margin-left: 20px;"><li>If a well has a defined test device, then that test
    device will be selected automatically.</li><li>If facility has a default test
    device, then that device will be selected automatically.</li><li>If facility has
    only one test device, then that device will be selected automatically.</li><li>If
    all above conditions do not meet, no default test device will be selected.</li></ul><p

    and 4 will only display wells of injection type.</p><p>Data section 5 will implicitly
    display the associated Well Bore Interval. User will not be able to edit this
    data section from screen.</p>'
