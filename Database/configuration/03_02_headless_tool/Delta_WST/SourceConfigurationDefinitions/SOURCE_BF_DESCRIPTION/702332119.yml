  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This business function is used to maintain the profit center split
    on streams. How the split is used is up to allocation but one example is that
    a profit center can decide how much of an output from a node should go on one
    stream and how much should go on another.</p><p>All streams that should be available
    on this screen must be added to the stream set "Maintain Stream Profit Centre
    Split".</p><p>A split for a profit center is valid from the Start Date until the
    End Date. If no End Date is given, the split is still valid. The first record
    on the stream must be inserted with the insert button. The Start Date will be
    equal to the navigator date, and the End Date will be open for this first record.
    To create more records for a stream on the same date, press the insert button.
    If the navigator date is after the Start Date, and before End Date or no End Date
    exists, you will see the previous inserted records on the screen. When clicking
    the insert button to create new records for other profit centers, the new records
    will not get the navigator date, but the same Start Date and End Date as the records
    shown on the screen.</p><p>To create records for the same profit centers but a
    different date, the "Copy Current Split" button must be used. This button will
    set the End Date of the current records equal to the date in the navigator, and
    create new records for the profit centers with Start Date equal to the date in
    the navigator. The End Date will even be updated if the current records already
    had End Date. In that case, the new records will get that End Date.</p><p>Additional
    validation rules could be added to the allocation.</p><p><u><em>Example 1: </em></u></p><p><em>Assuming
    that there are N streams from the given node then a percentage should be added
    to N-1 of the streams in this screen. The final stream need not have a split as
    it will get the remaining. </em></p><p><em>Rules within allocation: </em></p><ul
    style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li><em>If any of the splits are
    &lt; 0 for the cur node, report this as a configuration error.</em></li><li><em>If
    the splits for a given profit center totals more than 100 across the current node,
    report this as a configuration error.</em></li><li><em>If a given profit center
    has a valid, non-zero outgoing mass for any component on the current node, but
    does not have at least 1 valid, non-zero split, report this as a configuration
    error.</em></li><li><em>Assuming the above, if a given profit center has a valid,
    non-zero outgoing mass for any component on the current node, the allocation will
    calculate the final streams split request as 100 - sum(split requests for that
    profit center for the current node).</em></li></ul>'
