  DESCRIPTION: <p>Swapping is the logical concept of moving a quantity of hydrocarbon from one flow to another, where the two flows have no physical connection. How owners wish to give or get hydrocarbon is specified by Swap Requests. The hydrocarbon component records will be created from the component set "Stream Swap Components". What hydrocarbon components to include in the component set must be defined by each project.</p><p>The stream in the navigator is the stream from which the swap request is originating. Only streams that are part of the stream set "Stream set for component swapping" will be available in this business function.</p><p>To create a new swap request for a company a new line must be added to the first section. When it is saved the next section is created and swap requests can be added to the different hydrocarbon components.</p><p>A swap request for a company is valid from the Start Date until the End Date. If no End Date is given, the swap request is still valid. When a new swap request is added to a company and a swap request already exists there are some rules.</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Overlapping periods is not allowed for the same company.</li><li>Holes in the periods are allowed for a company. (If not, it must be handled by allocation)</li><li>If a new row is inserted for a company and a period already exists, the end date is set equal to the new start date on the existing factor if the end date is empty.</li></ul><p>A swap request is a percentage (between -100 and 100) at the component level on a given flow. Where:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>+100 imply that the owner wants to "get" as much extra as possible of the given component in the given flow.</li><li>0 or empty implies that the owner wants no change to the given component at the given flow.</li><li>-100 implies that the owner wants to "give" 100% of the given component at the given flow.</li></ul><p>The usage of the actual swapped values is de by calculation rules set by the individual implementation project.</p>
