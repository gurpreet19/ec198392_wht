  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Data Extract Setup screen</strong> is used to create
    Data Extract objects that are to be used in cost reporting.<br>- Data Extract
    objects hold information about one cost report type, e.g. regulatory reports.<br>-
    Data Extract objects are used to create so-called <strong><em>Extract Documents</em></strong>,
    which hold Data Entry data received from internal or external sources summed and
    based on a Tag. <br>These data will serve as basis for any regulatory or cost
    based report.</p><p>    <strong>Data Extract Type</strong> attributes reflect
    what type of Data Extract the user wants to create.<br>    <strong>- Actual</strong>
    summaries are based on actual Data entry data and are not editable.<br>    <strong>-
    Forecast</strong> summaries can also be based on actual Data Entries, but can
    also be manual input. How a forecast Data Extract is populated, is determined
    by <strong><em>Forecast Population Method</em></strong>.<br>    <strong><em>---
    Last Actual</em></strong>: Populates the Data Extract document based on the last
    approved Actual Data Extract.<br>    <strong><em>--- Last Forecast</em></strong>:
    Populates the Data Extract document based on the last approved Forecast Data Extract.<br>    <strong><em>---
    Previous Month</em></strong>: (Not implemented)<br>    <strong><em>--- Manual
    Input</em></strong>: Populates an empty Data Extract document so that the user
    can provide the values manually.</p><p>    <strong>Parent Journal Extract Setup</strong>
    is required for forecast type Journal Extract setup objects and indicates what
    Journal Extract setup object is to be used as input for the forecast Journal Extract
    document. <br>The last available approved Journal Extract document from the parent
    Journal Extract setup has got tag values that are used as forecast values for
    the same tag.</p>'
