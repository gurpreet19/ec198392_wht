  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Daily List Overview screen</strong>    is used to maintain
    List of Stream Items, their Calc Methods and Conversion Factors.<br>    Quantity
    numbers are entered according to a predefined List containing a list of Stream
    Items. The lists    of stream items are defined in Input List screen (BF CD.0035).</p><p>    In
    the Daily List Overview screen all stream items are listed independent of type:<br>    <strong><em>-
    IP</em></strong>    for Input, <strong><em>- SK</em></strong> for Split key, <strong><em>-
    FO</em></strong> for Formula.<br>    In Daily List Input screen (BF VO.0002) only
    Input (IP) type of stream items are included.</p><p>    <u>For each stream item
    up to 6 different quantities may be entered:</u><br>    - One Volume quantity<br>    -
    One Energy quantity<br>    - One Mass quantity<br>    - 3 Extra quantities, any
    UOM</p><p>    <u>Each stream item is defined with a master UOM group. That is
    V for Volume, M for Mass or E for Energy.</u>    <br> The quantity is normally
    entered in the master UOM and other quantities are calculated by the system using
    conversion logic and cascade logic. The    following will describe the calculations
    the save operation does.</p><h3>    <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Navigator</strong>
    </h3><p>    Navigator filters List Objects based on a Date chosen. The user should
    be sure the Instantiation is done for the chosen Date.</p><h3>        <strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">List Object Section</strong> </h3><p>    The section
    lists List Objects found according to the Navigator settings.</p><h3>        <strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Overview Table Tab</strong></h3><p>    This section
    lists all Stream Items connected to the chosen List.     The user is able to view
    and modify Conversion Factors for each Stream Item in the List.<br>    Each Stream
    Item is defined with a calculation method (STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD).</p><p>    <u>Valid
    values for CM (Calculation Method):</u><br>    <strong><em>- IP</em></strong>    :
    Manual input or by interface.<br>    <strong><em>- SK</em></strong>    Calculated
    using a split key. The split keys are defined in the CD module.<br>    <strong><em>-
    FO:</em></strong>    Calculated using a formula. The formula is defined on the
    stream item in the CD module.<br>    <strong><em>- EK:</em></strong>    Calculated
    using an exceptional split key, i.e. the number has been calculated based on a
    new split key share entered by the user.<br>    <strong><em>- OW:</em></strong>    The
    user has overwritten the master quantity on a FO or a SK stream item. This means
    the cascade will not include the stream item again in any new cascade    operation.<br>    <strong><em>-
    CO:</em></strong>    The number is a constant.<br>    <strong><em>- SP:</em></strong>    The
    number is coming from SP (Sales and Purchases module) and is a sum of quantities
    from one or more SP documents.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0,
    153, 0);">RESET SELECTED CALC METHOD</span></strong><br>    The button enables
    to reset the Calc Method for the selected Stream Item.<br>    - If the user has
    overwritten the master quantity on a FO or a SK stream item the CM (Calc Method)
    column will change to OW and the way to bring back the    number and CM (Calc
    Method) is to press the button.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0,
    153, 0);">RESET SELECTED CONVERSION FACTORS</span></strong><br>    The button
    enables to reset the Conversion Factor for the selected Stream Item.<br>    -
    If a quantity, other than the master UOM quantity, is overwritten for a Stream
    Item, the system deletes the Conversion Factor that was used to calculate    the
    quantity.<br>    - If a user has changed a conversion factor or changed a non-master
    quantity it is possible to bring back the originally Conversion Factor on the
    selected    Stream Item by pressing the button. The quantity will then be recalculated.</p><p>    <strong>CONVERSION
    LOGIC</strong><br>    Each stream item is defined with a master UOM group and
    a corresponding master UOM. The 5 additional quantities are optional to use. If
    a UOM is defined    for one of the non-master quantities the conversion logic
    calculates the quantity based on a conversion factor. This conversion factor can
    be either a    standard conversion factor within a UOM group or a inter group
    conversion factor used across UOM groups i.e. a calculation from a Volume UOM
    to a Mass UOM.</p><p>    <u>UOM group conversions for a stream item takes place
    in the following situations:</u><br>    1. When the master UOM Group quantity
    changes; for all UOM Groups unless at the same time other quantities are provided
    for such UOM groups. This will    overwrite any previous calculated or manually
    entered quantities.<br>    2. When any of conversion the factors defined for a
    stream item is changed at stream item level. This will overwrite any previous
    calculated or manually    entered quantities.<br>    3. When any of the UOM Group
    quantities other than the master are NULL provided that a valid UOM is defined.
    If no UOM is defined the conversion will not    take place.</p><p>    An inter-UOM
    group conversion is always calculated from the master UOM Group quantity to any
    other UOM Group as long as a valid conversion factor is    available. This is
    independent of any enabling / disabling of data entry fields.<br>    Standard
    conversions are always within a UOM group and apply a set of standard conversion
    factors, which will apply to all such calculations in the system.</p><p>    <u>        Whenever
    a stream item is configured to use one or more of the Extra fields, the system
    will automatically perform standard UOM conversions for the        following situations:    </u><br>    1.
    When the master UOM Group quantity changes unless at the same time other quantities
    are provided for such Extra fields. This will overwrite any previous    calculated
    or manually entered quantities.<br>    2. When any of the Extra quantities are
    NULL provided that a valid UOM is defined. If no UOM is defined the conversion
    will not take place.</p><p>    The cascade logic starts also the conversion calculations
    if the other involved stream items are defined with other UOMs.</p><p>    <strong>Button
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">VIEW CASCADE</span></strong><br>    The button
    explains how the selected number was calculated using other numbers.</p><p>        <strong>CASCADE
    LOGIC</strong><br>    <u>The cascade operation for a stream item will run automatically
    by the following situations:</u><br>    1. If any quantity in the volume/mass/energy
    fields has been changed by user.<br>    2. If the split share changes (calc_method
    SK to EK).<br>    3. If the conversion factors changes.</p><p>    The cascade
    operation will calculate all numbers depending on the number entered. The cascade
    calculation process is a recursive operation where each    number that has been
    recalculated may lead to recalculation of other stream item values as well. The
    cascade process will calculate only those stream item    values having STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD
    / STIM_MTH_VALUE.CALC_METHOD set to SK, EK or FO.</p><p>    The cascade logic
    itself will only calculate the master UOM group quantity of a stream item. Upon
    saving the calculated figure further conversion logic    will apply, i.e. across
    to other quantities, either within same UOM group or a different one.</p><h3>    <strong
