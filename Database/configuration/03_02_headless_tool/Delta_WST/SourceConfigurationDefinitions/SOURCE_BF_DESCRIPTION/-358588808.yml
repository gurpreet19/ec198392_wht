  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to maintain default recovery factors for a nomination location. The screen will show how much each component is used for producing a product. Recovery Factors in this business function are stored per nomination location, product, component and date.</p><p>The screen will have two data sections; one will list all the distinct dates in the selected period. The second data section will display the factors as a crosstab, using SimpleCrossTabTransformer. BREAK_ATTRIBUTE&nbsp;=&nbsp;COMPONENT</p><p>Insert and delete of records can be done from the daytime data section. User can select a date to create new records. When saving all records from the previous day will be created with the new date. When deleting all records of the selected date will be deleted.</p><p>A component set will hold the sort order for the components&nbsp;(COMP_TRAN_FACTOR).</p><p>By default this screen stores the factor values to a data class where Nomination Location is the owner. The navigator uses a default navigation model where Nomination Location is the target.</p><p>It is possibility to store data on a class which have a different owner than Nomination Location.</p><p>To use this business function to store data on different class than the default one&nbsp;(Nomination Location) the implement project can create a new treeview entry with arguments on the URL. The TARGET argument is used in the navigator and must match the owner for the data class. The CLASS argument is used for the table data section. The CLASS_DAY argument is used for the daytime data section. It is a requirement that the TARGET can be found in a navigation model, and that the target is the owner of the data in the CLASS.</p><p>The navigation model uses by default TRAN_OPERATIONAL, but a different navigational model can be used by sending the navigational model as an argument from the treeview&nbsp;(argument NAV_MODEL). When using a different navigational model it is important to be aware of the owner of the data class and the target must be the same object.</p><p>The implement project can also create their own classes to store factors which have an alternative owner for this business function.</p><p>Default the From Date and To Date will use normal date format, but the project can also choose to send in a different format on the treeview url, for example MONTH.</p><p>Mandatory arguments which are needed in the url are CLASS, CLASS_DAY and DIM1_KEY. DIM1_KEY is the arguments used for sorting the product on the screen. When using this BF to store factors on a different owner class than the default one we need to send in TARGET as well.</p>
