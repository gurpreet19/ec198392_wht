  DESCRIPTION: <p>This BF is used to start jobs that verify or approve daily data sets for a single date or reversely. The jobs (process IDs) are configured in a hierarchical structure. Running a parent job runs all tasks defined for that job plus child jobs and their tasks. Parameters from the parent job are passed to the child jobs, replacing their default parameter list.</p><p>The upper section of the screen lists all jobs the user is allowed to run. The parent-child relation is not displayed, but should be understood reading the text.</p><p>The second section lists all jobs executed for the date in the navigator. This is a report log and all users are able to see this list even if they are not allowed to run a process. The list shows current status of daily data set, when it was last executed, how many rows were updated and who ran the process. If a parent job is run, the report will also list child jobs. Jobs should be configured so that they cover all data a role within the system is responsible for.</p>
