  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used for setting up many-to-many relationships between nomination locations.</p><p>Configuration entered in this screen will typically be used to resolve Entry vs Exit Delivery Stream relationships needed when scheduling and allocation calculations require netting of bidirectional contractual flows to determine the physical flow. If the project has decided to use Delivery Point as the Nomination Location rather than Delivery Stream, then association of Delivery Point objects is also available as a configuration alternative.</p><p>The same Nomination Locations can be associated in different ways, by specifying a different Connection Type code as part of the key. The standard Connection Type codes shipped with EC are NetFlow and PathFlow. NetFlow is for the association of entry and exit flow direction forming a bidirectional relationship. While PathFlow are having either Parent to Child or Child to Parent flow direction.</p><p>The user selects the date, business unit and/or nomination location in the navigator. Any associated nomination locations connected to the selected location are displayed. The user can add new rows, and set date ranges for which the association is valid. There is also a Connection Type popup in the navigator to filter the data based on the connection type. Connection Type is default to &lsquo;Net Flow&rsquo;.</p><p>This screen takes NAV_MODEL, TARGET, BF_PROFILE and CLASS as parameters on the URL to make it possible for projects to create separate screens for different objects. The database table is generic, making it possible to build additional classes on top - for different objects. When using a different navigational model it is important to be aware of the owner of the data class and the target must be the same object. There are also TRAN_NOMLOC_CONN and TRAN_NOMLOC_CONN_POPUP parameters on the URL that is used to default the navigator value for Connection Type popup. These are also configurable by the user.</p><p>The business function supports profiling on Nomination Location, grouping objects that belong to a certain profile.</p>
