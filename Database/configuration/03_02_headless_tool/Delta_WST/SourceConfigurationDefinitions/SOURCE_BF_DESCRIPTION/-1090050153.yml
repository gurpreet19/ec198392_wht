  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The business function for &ldquo;Production Test Events&rdquo; displays all event records in the selected <em>production test measurement data set </em>registered on <em>Test </em><em>Device</em>, <em>Flowline </em>and <em>Well </em>objects. All event data for all the specific objects participating in the test will be displayed. The data in the sections 1, 2, 4, 6 is based on information entered in business function PT.0005 &ndash; Production test define.</p>

    <p>The data in data sections 3, 5, 7 typically originate from manual input made by operators or laboratory technicians on the test station. Depending on the <em>Use in result </em>&ndash;flag, the data from PT.0007 can potentially be used in result calculations and thus have impact on data in</p>

    <p>PT.0010 Production test Result</p>

    <p>PT.0011 Production test Result combination</p>

    <p>PT.0012 Production test Result history</p>

    <p>The business function contains a <em>navigator section </em>and seven <em>data sections</em>. The display of data sections is controlled by the use of screen tabs. The overall layout of the screen will be according to the following possible combinations:</p>

    <p>The <strong>navigator </strong>section enables the selection of a time window (from date &ndash; to date). There must be an overlap between the navigator From-To and the Start-End time interval of the <em>production test measurement data set </em>for the test to be listed. From Date &lt; End Date AND To Date &gt; Start Date.</p>

    <p>The navigator is based on the operational group model down to the well level. The well element is optional. The <em>production test measurement data set </em>must contain the selected well as an active well in order to be listed. In addition to that, the well must have a defined instrumentation type in order to be displayed in the list.</p>

    <p>Navigator selections are applied when pressing the [GO] &ndash;button.</p>

    <p><strong>Data section 1 </strong>lists all <em>production test measurement data sets </em>that satisfy the navigation criteria sorted descending on Start Date (most recent on top). The list is scrollable and supports single record selection. Collapse/expand functionality should be activated. There are no editable data elements in data section 1. The selected record in this data section controls the content of the data sections 2, 4 and 6. Initial focus is the top row in the data section.</p>

    <p><strong>Data section 2 </strong>shows the <em>Test Device </em>configured in the <em>production test measurement data set </em>selected in data section 1. There can only be one test device associated with a test. The test device is initially selected and all test event data for that specific test device will be listed in data section 3.</p>

    <p><strong>Data section 3 </strong>lists all available test event data for the <em>Test Device </em>focused in Data section 2. Records are sorted on <em>Event time </em>in a descending order (most recent data on top). Initial selection is the top row in the data section. The time window (To/from date) for the record listing is defined by the Start date and End date from the selected record in data section 1. There is a scrollbar to the right that enables fast access to the entire data set. New records can be created in the test event record list using the Insert button in the toolbar. All elements in the test event record list are editable except the test event time, which is locked upon initial save. The event type is selected from a dropdown populated with valid test event codes from EC codes. The unit of measure (UOM) is selected from a dropdown populated with valid test event UOM&rsquo;s from EC codes. Trending is activated for the quantity element in this data section.</p>
