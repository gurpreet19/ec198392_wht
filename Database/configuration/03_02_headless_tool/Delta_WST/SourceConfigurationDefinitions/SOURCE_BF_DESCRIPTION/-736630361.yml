  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to show sub-daily results from contract calculations. The screen is read only, and is populated from calculation processes. There is&nbsp;currently no Sub Daily Contract Calculation business function for initiating sub-daily contract calculations. This business function must therefore be used for sub-daily&nbsp;results of daily (or higher) calculations, or the calculations must be performed as part of other sub-daily calculations like sub-daily allocation calculations.</p><p>After selecting a date and a contract, all the hours of that contract day will show in the Sub Daily data section. After selecting an hour in the Sub Daily data section,&nbsp;the results for that hour are shown per contract account.</p>
