  DESCRIPTION: <p>This Business Function is used to create and configure planned wells. A Planned well is a virtual well, which might or might not get drilled in the future. A planned well will get 'Active Well Status' as PLANNED upon creation.</p><p>When a well is commercially producing, it can be converted into an active well by changing the status from PLANNED to OPEN. Once a planned well is converted to a regular well, its status cannot be changed back to PLANNED. Rest of the well' s configuration can be done in the Well(CO.0049) or the Maintain Wells(CO.0050) screen.
