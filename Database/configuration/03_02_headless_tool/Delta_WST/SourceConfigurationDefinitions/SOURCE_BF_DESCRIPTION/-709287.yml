  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to start calculation jobs for the gas dispatching module, and further to view the execution logs.</p><p>The typical usage of this business function is to view the execution log for scheduled calculation jobs. To view the execution log, select Date, Calculation Network and Calculation Job. The job details are displayed in new rows on the screen, one for each run, along with the outcome (e.g. Success of Failure). By highlighting a row from the upper section of the screen, i.e. an individual calculation run, the associated log file summary from that run is displayed in the lower section of the screen and the user can press the Download button to examine the full log file.</p><p>From this business function it is also possible to manually start calculation jobs. To start job, select Date, Calculation Network and Calculation Job. To schedule the job, Job Start Time is entered, and the &ldquo;Run Estimate Calculation&rdquo; button is pressed. All started estimate calculation jobs will show in the Running Jobs section (showing Start Time, Status). Several estimate calculations may run simultaneously, but only one for each calculation job.</p><p>Approved calculation can be re-run again if the system property flag &ldquo;Allow re-running calculation&rdquo; in Maintain System Settings is &lsquo;Y&rsquo;.</p><p>There are also Logging level-popup to choose log level and Simulate-checkbox. Log Level is default to &lsquo;No Details&rsquo;. The &quot;Simulate&quot; tick box may be used to run the calculations and inspect the subsequent log file, but without writing any results back to the database.</p>
