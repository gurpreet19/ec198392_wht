  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Monthly Node Overview screen</strong>    is used to
    maintain List of Stream Items, their Calc Methods and Conversion Factors for the
    Node (Field/Field Group) selected.</p><p>    All stream items are listed independent
    of type:<br>    <strong><em>- IP</em></strong>    for Input, <strong><em>- SK</em></strong>
    for Split key, <strong><em>- FO</em></strong> for Formula.<br>    In Monthly Node
    Input screen (BF VO.0021) only Input (IP) type of Stream Items are included.</p><p>    <u>For
    each stream item up to 6 different quantities may be entered:</u><br>    - One
    Volume quantity<br>    - One Energy quantity<br>    - One Mass quantity<br>    -
    3 Extra quantities, any UOM</p><p>    <u>Each stream item is defined with a master
    UOM group. That is V for Volume, M for Mass or E for Energy.</u><br>    The quantity
    is normally entered in the master UOM and other quantities are calculated by the
    system using conversion logic and cascade logic. The    following will describe
    the calculations the save operation does.</p><h3>    <strong style="color: rgb(0,
    0, 153);">Navigator</strong></h3><p>    Navigator filters Node and Field Objects
    based on a Month chosen. The user should be sure the Instantiation is done for
    the chosen Month.</p><h3>        <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Node Object

    Table Tab</strong></h3><p>    This section lists all Stream Items connected to
    the chosen Stream.<br>    The user is able to view and modify Conversion Factors
    for each Stream Item in the Stream.<br>    Each Stream Item is defined with a
    calculation method (STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD).</p><p>    <u>Valid values for
    CM (Calculation Method):</u><br>    <strong><em>- IP</em></strong>    : Manual
    input or by interface.<br>    <strong><em>- SK</em></strong>    Calculated using
    a split key. The split keys are defined in the CD module.<br>    <strong><em>-
    FO:</em></strong>    Calculated using a formula. The formula is defined on the
    stream item in the CD module.<br>    <strong><em>- EK:</em></strong>    Calculated
    using an exceptional split key, i.e. the number has been calculated based on a
    new split key share entered by the user.<br>    <strong><em>- OW:</em></strong>    The
    user has overwritten the master quantity on a FO or a SK stream item. This means
    the cascade will not include the stream item again in any new cascade    operation.<br>    <strong><em>-
    CO:</em></strong>    The number is a constant.<br>    <strong><em>- SP:</em></strong>    The
    number is coming from SP (Sales and Purchases module) and is a sum of quantities
    from one or more SP documents.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0,
    153, 0);">RESET SELECTED CALC METHOD</span></strong><br>    The button enables
    to reset the Calc Method for the selected Stream Item.</p><p>    If the user has
    overwritten the master quantity on a FO or a SK stream item the CM (Calc Method)
    column will change to OW and the way to bring back the    number and CM (Calc
    Method) is to press the button.</p><p>    <strong>Button <span style="color: rgb(0,
    153, 0);">RESET SELECTED CONVERSION FACTORS</span></strong><span style="color:
    rgb(0, 153, 0);"></span><br>    The button enables to reset the Conversion Factor
    for the selected Stream Item.<br>    - If a quantity, other than the master UOM
    quantity, is overwritten for a Stream Item, the system deletes the Conversion
    Factor that was used to calculate    the quantity.<br>    - If a user has changed
    a conversion factor or changed a non-master quantity it is possible to bring back
    the originally Conversion Factor on the selected    Stream Item by pressing the
    button. The quantity will then be recalculated.</p><p>    <strong>CONVERSION LOGIC</strong><br>    Each
    stream item is defined with a master UOM group and a corresponding master UOM.
    The 5 additional quantities are optional to use. If a UOM is defined    for one
    of the non-master quantities the conversion logic calculates the quantity based
    on a conversion factor. This conversion factor can be either a    standard conversion
    factor within a UOM group or a inter group conversion factor used across UOM groups
    i.e. a calculation from a Volume UOM to a Mass UOM.</p><p>    <u>UOM group conversions
    for a stream item takes place in the following situations:</u><br>    1. When
    the master UOM Group quantity changes; for all UOM Groups unless at the same time
    other quantities are provided for such UOM groups. This will    overwrite any
    previous calculated or manually entered quantities.<br>    2. When any of conversion
    the factors defined for a stream item is changed at stream item level. This will
    overwrite any previous calculated or manually    entered quantities.<br>    3.
    When any of the UOM Group quantities other than the master are NULL provided that
    a valid UOM is defined. If no UOM is defined the conversion will not    take place.</p><p>    An
    inter-UOM group conversion is always calculated from the master UOM Group quantity
    to any other UOM Group as long as a valid conversion factor is    available. This
    is independent of any enabling / disabling of data entry fields.<br>    Standard
    conversions are always within a UOM group and apply a set of standard conversion
    factors, which will apply to all such calculations in the system.</p><p>    <u>        Whenever
    a stream item is configured to use one or more of the Extra fields, the system
    will automatically perform standard UOM conversions for the        following situations:    </u><br>    1.
    When the master UOM Group quantity changes unless at the same time other quantities
    are provided for such Extra fields. This will overwrite any previous    calculated
    or manually entered quantities.<br>    2. When any of the Extra quantities are
    NULL provided that a valid UOM is defined. If no UOM is defined the conversion
    will not take place.</p><p>    The cascade logic starts also the conversion calculations
    if the other involved stream items are defined with other UOMs.</p><p>    <strong>Button
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">VIEW CASCADE</span></strong><span style="color:
    rgb(0, 153, 0);"></span><br>    The button explains how the selected number was
    calculated using other numbers.</p><p>        <strong>CASCADE LOGIC</strong><br>    <u>The
    cascade operation for a stream item will run automatically by the following situations:</u><br>    1.
    If any quantity in the volume/mass/energy fields has been changed by user.<br>    2.
    If the split share changes (calc_method SK to EK).<br>    3. If the conversion
    factors changes.</p><p>    The cascade operation will calculate all numbers depending
    on the number entered. The cascade calculation process is a recursive operation
    where each    number that has been recalculated may lead to recalculation of other
    stream item values as well. The cascade process will calculate only those stream
    item    values having STIM_DAY_VALUE.CALC_METHOD / STIM_MTH_VALUE.CALC_METHOD
    set to SK, EK or FO.</p><p>    The cascade logic itself will only calculate the
    master UOM group quantity of a stream item. Upon saving the calculated figure
    further conversion logic    will apply, i.e. across to other quantities, either
    within same UOM group or a different one.</p><h3>    <strong style="color: rgb(0,
