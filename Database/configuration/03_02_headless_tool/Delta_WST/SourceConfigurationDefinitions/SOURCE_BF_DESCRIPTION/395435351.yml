  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used when period electrical stream data is available. Data can be entered manually or loaded automatically. The BF requires one entry per stream per day, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all electrical streams that are part of a stream set for this screen. Thus, this BF has value instantiation for the Day start where blank line for all measured steam streams will be inserted.</p>
