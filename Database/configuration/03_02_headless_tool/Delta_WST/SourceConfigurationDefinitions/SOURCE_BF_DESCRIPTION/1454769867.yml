  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The Chemical Injection Point screen is a configuration BF that provides a user interface to link a chemical product to an injection point (asset type, asset) and maintenance of existing injection points.</p>

    <p>Chemicals can have a recommended injection either as a concentration (Ppm - Parts per million) or as a volume (e.g. barrel, cubic meter). There are three different ways to register how much is injected as below:</p>
    <p>-  Volume injected - directly metered</p>
    <p>-  PPM injected - volume can be calculated using asset flow rate * Ppm concentration / 1000000</p>
    <p>-  On Time - volume can be calculated from recommended dosage / hours in the day * on_time OR if recommended dosage is in ppm: Recommended dosage / hours in the day * on_time * Asset Volume / 1000000</p>

    <p>The recommended dosage can be either a concentration (Ppm) or a volume (.e.g. m3).</p>

    <p>Important: If it is a volume, it has to be in the same unit as the Asset Type & Asset is using. There are currently no support to handle unit conversion between recommended volume and asset volume.</p>
