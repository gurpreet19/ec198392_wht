  DESCRIPTION: <p>The screen is a configuration screen for Lifting Volume Tolerance. These values are used in selection-lists (a.k.a. Popups) where Tolerance Type is set, e.g. in the&nbsp;Nomination Entry business function for the parcel nominations. The min and max percentage are used as base numbers for calculation of the Nominated Min Qty&nbsp;and Nominated Max Qty, e.g. with a defined tolerance (Requested Tolerance Type) where Min Qty holds a value of 5% and Max Qty holds value of 5% will result in&nbsp;Nominated Min Qty of 5% less than the nominated qty and a Nominated Max Qty of 5% more than then nominated qty. The tolerance type must be applied to&nbsp;requested, nominated (uses the same as requested) and scheduled quantities.</p>
