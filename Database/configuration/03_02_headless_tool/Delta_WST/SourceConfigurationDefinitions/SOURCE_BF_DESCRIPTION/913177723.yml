  DESCRIPTION: <p>    <strong>Customer screen</strong>    is used to define the Customers available for the Contracts in the system.</p><p>    <u>Note</u>    that for each Company defined as a Contract Owner Company there must exist    a corresponding Customer object which has then a relation to the Company in    question.<br>    This applies if there will be for Purchase / Tariff Income / Journal Entry    contracts in the system. The link to the Contract Owner Company is through    the Company relation of the Customer object.<br>    These Customers must also have the Customer Group set to SELF / Contract    Owner Customer.</p><p>    EC has the option to have undefined Customer on a Contract. This concept    can be used if there are multiple Customers for the Contact but for each    individual financial document (i.e. invoice) only one of these Customers is    applicable. <br> The customer for the document can either come from the    interfaced data or being entered manually by user.</p>
