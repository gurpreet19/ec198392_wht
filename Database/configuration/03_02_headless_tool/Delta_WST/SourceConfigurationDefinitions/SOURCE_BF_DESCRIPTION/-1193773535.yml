  DESCRIPTION: "<p>This business function list the targets for the day and the daily\
    \ flow profile prorated the wet gas profile. The Wet Gas Hourly Profile (SD.0015)\
    \ can be used to view the wet gas numbers and change the wet gas profile.</p><p>The\
    \ first target for the day is created in Before Day target (SD.0018) and if changes\
    \ required new targets can be added during the day in Within Day Target (SD.0019).\
    \ All targets created for selected day in the navigator is listed in the first\
    \ section.</p><p>The next section list the hourly profile prorated the wet gas\
    \ profile. When a new target is created within the day the flow rates already\
    \ issued as a target up to the hour of issue of the new target are retained.</p><p>When\
    \ the target is initially issued, the prorating is quite simple. The daily target\
    \ is simply profiled over the day in proportion to any profile defined for the\
    \ wet gas. The situation becomes slightly more complex when a target has already\
    \ been issued for the day in which the original hourly figures are retained up\
    \ to the time of the change. The new target value is then used to calculate the\
    \ total for the remaining hours such that the overall average for the day now\
    \ equals the new target. Once the average values have been calculated, these values\
    \ are then profiled according to any profile defined for the wet gas in a similar\
    \ manner to that described above.</p><p>The formula for calculating the Dry Gas\
    \ hourly Profile for selected hour in the day is</br>\tDry gas Daily Total * (Wet\
    \ Gas Hourly Value / Wet Gas Daily Total)</br>The End of Day Target is the current\
    \ target for the selected hour.</p><p>Example when only one target: </br>Time\
