  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Forecast Quantity Properties screen</strong> is used to
    define the Quantity Forecast Cases for the system.</p><p>FUNCTION_AREA_CODE =
    QUANTITY_FORECAST</p><p>The system can handle two different types of Quantity
    Forecast Cases:</p><p><strong>Plan</strong></p><p>POPULATE_METHOD = PLAN</p><p>This
    type of Quantity Forecast Case will not be updated with data from the Quantities
    module when using the "Populate Forecast Case" function (see more details on this
    function later in this document). It will not be influenced by the Quantities
    data.</p><p><strong>Closing Forecast</strong></p><p>POPULATE_METHOD = YEAR_TO_MONTH</p><p>A
    Closing Forecast type of Quantity Forecast Case will consist of both Plan data
    and Final/Accrual data (picked up from the Quantities module)</p><p>Attribute:
    POPULATE_METHOD = PLAN | YEAR_TO_MONTH</p><p>Through this BF the user can:</p><ul><li>Create
    new Quantity Forecast Cases - Create a completely new Quantity Forecast Case.</li><li>Modify
    Quantity Forecast Cases - Modify attributes of existing Quantity Forecast Cases.</li><li>Populate
    Quantity Forecast Cases - Populate Quantity Forecast Cases of type "Closing Forecast"
    (POPULATE_METHOD = YEAR_TO_MONTH) with Final/Accrual data from the Quantities
    module.</li><li>Copy Quantity Forecast Cases - Copy an existing Quantity Forecast
    Case to a new Quantity Forecast Case. Attributes of the new Quantity Forecast
    Case can be modified.</li><li>Delete Quantity Forecast Cases - It is not allowed
    to delete a Quantity Forecast Case which is PUBLIC, set to OFFICIAL and has status
    APPROVED.</li></ul><p>The BF consists of these screen sections:</p><p><strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 71, 178);">Filter Navigator</strong></p><p>the YEAR selector
    of the Filter Navigator determines which forecast cases to show. It will list
    all quantity forecast cases being valid for the selected year.</p><p>Lists only
    the forecast cases being PUBLIC or PRIVATE for the user logged in.</p><p><strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 71, 178);">Action Buttons</strong></p><p>This section has
    two buttons:</p><p><strong>Button </strong><strong style="color: rgb(0, 138, 0);">Populate
    Forecast Case </strong></p><p><strong>Button </strong><strong style="color: rgb(0,
    138, 0);">Copy Forecast Case </strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 71,
    178);">Quantity Forecast Cases Details</strong></p><p>This section lists the attributes
    of the selected Quantity Forecast Case in the Filter Navigator</p><p>Quantity
    Forecast Case Validation</p><p>There can only exist ONE Quantity Forecast Case
    for each combination of the following attributes:</p><p>FORECAST.POPULATE_METHOD&nbsp;=
    YEAR_TO_MONTH</p><p>FORECAST.YEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &lt;year&gt;</p><p>FORECAST.MONTH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
    &lt;month &gt;</p><p>FORECAST.FORECAST_SCOPE&nbsp;= &lt;PUBLIC &gt;</p><p>FORECAST.OFFICIAL_IND&nbsp;&nbsp;=
    &lt;Y &gt;</p><p>In other words, there can only exist one official Closing Forecast
    for each Month/Year. This must be validated when saving the attributes for a Quantity
    Forecast Case, and an error message must be issued if this validation rule is
    breached.</p><p>Also, there can only exist ONE Quantity Forecast Case for each
    combination of the following attributes:</p><p>FORECAST.POPULATE_METHOD&nbsp;=
    PLAN</p><p>FORECAST.YEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &lt;year&gt;</p><p>FORECAST. FORECAST_SCOPE&nbsp;=
    &lt;PUBLIC &gt;</p><p>FORECAST.OFFICIAL_IND&nbsp;&nbsp;= &lt;Y &gt;</p><p>In other
    words, there can only exist one official Plan for each Year. This must be validated
    when saving the attributes for a Quantity Forecast Case, and an error message
    must be issued if this validation rule is breached.</p><p>When the object start
    date has been changed, all the related quantities will be removed and the plan
    date year will automatically set to year same as object start year.</p><p>The
    plan date year must be in between object start year and end year.</p><p><br></p><p>Populating
    Quantity Forecast Cases from external sources</p><p>Existing Quantity Forecast
    Cases can be updated with quantity data from external sources by executing a Scheduler
    Job: "UpdateQtyForecast". The input to the scheduler job will be a CSV file with
    reference to which Quantity Forecast Case to update. The upload will update the
    quantities for the stream items listed in the CSV file AND being part of the Quantity
    Forecast Case in question. The upload will trigger the Cascade logic.</p><p><br></p><p>The
    business function for "Forecast Quantity Properties" displays each forecast case
    details by selecting one of the created forecast case in filter navigator/</p><p>The
    business function contains a navigator section and details data sections.&nbsp;The
    overall layout of the screen will be according to the following possible combinations:</p><p>Sections&nbsp;Description</p><p>Navigator&nbsp;Always
    visible</p><p>Data Section 1&nbsp;Always visible, but collapse/expand functionality
    active</p><p>Data Section 2&nbsp;Always visible, showing two functional buttons

    section 1</p><p><br></p><p>The navigator section enables the selection of a time
    window (Year Selector).&nbsp;A set of Quantity Forecast Cases will be listed based
    on the selected forecast year in Year Selector.&nbsp;OBJECT_START_DATE = YEAR.</p><p>Data
    section 1 lists all Quantity Forecast Cases that satisfy the navigation criteria
    (Functional Area Code = QUANTITY_FORECAST) sorted descending on Year (most recent
    on top).&nbsp;The list is scrollable and supports single record selection.&nbsp;Collapse/expand
    functionality should be activated.&nbsp;There are no editable data elements in
    data section 1.&nbsp;The selected record in this data section controls the content
    of the data section 3.&nbsp;Initial focus is the top row in the data section.</p><p>Data
    section 2 shows the two functional buttons which are Populate Forecast Case and
    Copy Forecast Case. There are no editable data elements in data section 2.</p><p>Data
    section 3 shows the details of selected quantity forecast case in filter navigator
    in Form style. The details of data can be updated and saved into database. This
    section also shows an empty form to allow user insert/create a new quantity forecast
    case while user presses new button in navigator.</p>'
