  DESCRIPTION: '<p>FUNCTION_AREA_CODE = QUANTITY_FORECAST</p><p>This BF defines the
    Quantity Forecast Cases for the system. </p><p>The system can handle two different
    types of Quantity Forecast Cases: <br>?&nbsp;?Plan? ? POPULATE_METHOD = PLAN<br>This
    type of Quantity Forecast Case will not be updated with data from the Quantities
    module when using the ?Populate Forecast Case? function (see more details on this
    function later in this document). It will not be influenced by the Quantities
    data.<br>?&nbsp;?Closing Forecast? ? POPULATE_METHOD = YEAR_TO_MONTH<br>A ?Closing
    Forecast? type of Quantity Forecast Case will consist of both Plan data and Final/Accrual
    data (picked up from the Quantities module)<br>?&nbsp;Attribute: POPULATE_METHOD
    = PLAN | YEAR_TO_MONTH</p><p>Through this BF the user can:<br>?&nbsp;Create new
    Quantity Forecast Cases<br>Create a completely new Quantity Forecast Case.</p><p>?&nbsp;Modify
    Quantity Forecast Cases<br>Modify attributes of existing Quantity Forecast Cases.</p><p>?&nbsp;Populate
    Quantity Forecast Cases<br>Populate Quantity Forecast Cases of type ?Closing Forecast?
    (POPULATE_METHOD = YEAR_TO_MONTH) with Final/Accrual data from the Quantities
    module. </p><p>?&nbsp;Copy Quantity Forecast Cases<br>Copy an existing Quantity
    Forecast Case to a new Quantity Forecast Case. Attributes of the new Quantity
    Forecast Case can be modified.</p><p>?&nbsp;Delete Quantity Forecast Cases<br>It
    is not allowed to delete a Quantity Forecast Case which is PUBLIC, set to OFFICIAL
    and has status APPROVED.</p><p>The BF consists of these screen sections:</p><p>?&nbsp;Filter
    Navigator<br>the YEAR selector of the Filter Navigator determines which forecast
    cases to show. It will list all quantity forecast cases being valid for the selected
    year.<br>Lists only the forecast cases being PUBLIC or PRIVATE for the user logged
    in. </p><p>?&nbsp;Action Buttons<br>This section has two buttons:<br>o&nbsp;Populate
    Forecast Case<br>o&nbsp;Copy Forecast Case</p><p>?&nbsp;Quantity Forecast Cases
    Details<br>This section lists the attributes of the selected Quantity Forecast
    Case in the Filter Navigator</p><p>Quantity Forecast Case Validation </p><p>There
    can only exist ONE Quantity Forecast Case for each combination of the following
    attributes:</p><p>FORECAST.POPULATE_METHOD&nbsp;= YEAR_TO_MONTH<br>FORECAST.YEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
    &lt;year&gt;<br>FORECAST.MONTH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &lt;month &gt;<br>FORECAST.FORECAST_SCOPE&nbsp;=
    &lt;PUBLIC &gt;<br>FORECAST.OFFICIAL_IND&nbsp;&nbsp;= &lt;Y &gt;</p><p>In other
    words, there can only exist one official Closing Forecast for each Month/Year.
    This must be validated when saving the attributes for a Quantity Forecast Case,
    and an error message must be issued if this validation rule is breached. </p><p>Also,
    there can only exist ONE Quantity Forecast Case for each combination of the following
    attributes:</p><p>FORECAST.POPULATE_METHOD&nbsp;= PLAN<br>FORECAST.YEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
    &lt;year&gt;<br>FORECAST. FORECAST_SCOPE&nbsp;= &lt;PUBLIC &gt;<br>FORECAST.OFFICIAL_IND
    &nbsp;&nbsp;= &lt;Y &gt;</p><p>In other words, there can only exist one official
    Plan for each Year. This must be validated when saving the attributes for a Quantity
    Forecast Case, and an error message must be issued if this validation rule is
    breached.</p><p>When the object start date has been changed, all the related quantities
    will be removed and the plan date year will automatically set to year same as
    object start year.</p><p>The plan date year must be in between object start year
    and end year.</p><p><br>Populating Quantity Forecast Cases from external sources</p><p>Existing
    Quantity Forecast Cases can be updated with quantity data from external sources
    by executing a Scheduler Job: ?UpdateQtyForecast?. The input to the scheduler
    job will be a CSV file with reference to which Quantity Forecast Case to update.
    The upload will update the quantities for the stream items listed in the CSV file
    AND being part of the Quantity Forecast Case in question. The upload will trigger
    the Cascade logic.<br>&nbsp;<br>The business function for &quot;Forecast Quantity
    Properties&quot; displays each forecast case details by selecting one of the created
    forecast case in filter navigator/</p><p>The business function contains a navigator
    section and details data sections.&nbsp; The overall layout of the screen will
    be according to the following possible combinations:</p><p>Sections&nbsp;Description</p><p>Navigator&nbsp;Always
    visible<br>Data Section 1&nbsp;Always visible, but collapse/expand functionality
    active<br>Data Section 2&nbsp;Always visible, showing two functional buttons ?
    Populate Forecast Case and Copy Forecast Case<br>Data Section 3&nbsp;Showing the
    active forecast case in the forecast case selected in Data section 1</p><p><br>The
    navigator section enables the selection of a time window (Year Selector).&nbsp;
    A set of Quantity Forecast Cases will be listed based on the selected forecast
    year in Year Selector.&nbsp; OBJECT_START_DATE = YEAR.</p><p>Data section 1 lists
    all Quantity Forecast Cases that satisfy the navigation criteria (Functional Area
    Code = QUANTITY_FORECAST) sorted descending on Year (most recent on top).&nbsp;
    The list is scrollable and supports single record selection.&nbsp; Collapse/expand
    functionality should be activated.&nbsp; There are no editable data elements in
    data section 1.&nbsp; The selected record in this data section controls the content
    of the data section 3.&nbsp; Initial focus is the top row in the data section.</p><p>Data
    section 2 shows the two functional buttons which are Populate Forecast Case and
    Copy Forecast Case. There are no editable data elements in data section 2.</p><p>Data
    section 3 shows the details of selected quantity forecast case in filter navigator
    in Form style. The details of data can be updated and saved into database. This
    section also shows an empty form to allow user insert/create a new quantity forecast
    case while user presses new button in navigator.<br></p>'
