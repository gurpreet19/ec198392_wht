  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>The business function is used to setup the blend contents for a given batch. It will also provide the ownership split values for the blend.</p>

    <p>To be able to sell and export the products in a processing plant they will normally be a part of a blend. The task of preparing a blend is called a batch. The screen is built as a batch with a setup of products. A blend will also have an ownership split between different companies.</p>

    <p>The first section provides the setup of a batch. A batch is specified for a given time and a blend type. The batch does also have a blend status. When a blend is approved, by clicking the approve button, transactions will be generated for the blend values. When a batch is saved, it will look up the product from the given recipie of the blend type and insert that as default rows in the blend content section / second section.</p>

    <p>The second data section shows the blend contents based on products and storages. Each product in the blend can be edited and provided with volume, density and mass values.</p>

    <p>The third section makes it possible to override the ownership for a specific / selected blend. It will also enable a comments attribute to comment each of the overridden values. Please note that the ownership is given for the blend, not the individual products.</p>
