  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This Business Function is used to keep track of oil transported
    from one or more production wells to a given single facility stream.</p><p>A typical
    example of use can be when:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Trucks
    are used to transport produced oil from wells not connected to a production pipeline.
    These wells produce into a tank. Trucks will then lift oil volumes from the tank
    and transport the oil to a facility or pump it into a nearby transport pipeline.</li><li>Transporting
    oil from wells when the transport pipeline is out of service</li></ul><p>A truck
    will load up fluids from one or more well. Below is a simple illustration of the
    scenario.</p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When loading fluids from each of
    the wells the truck driver will register the loaded amount into the trucking company
    registration system (laptop or a paper form). This will include:</span></p><ul
    style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Gross volume</li><li>BSW%</li></ul><p>At
    the receiving stream the following values will be registered:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:40px;"><li>Gross
    volume (excluding free water.)</li><li>BSW% (for the gross volume.)</li><li>Free
    Water (free water settled during transport will typically be drained of the truck
    and not pumping into the receiving stream.)</li></ul><p></p><p>Each loading/unloading
    operation has an associated <em>Ticket. </em>All tickets volumes transported in
    the same truck roundtrip are grouped into a <em>batch.&nbsp; </em>Typical usage
    of the screen is that an operator at the receiving facility will receive all tickets
    from the truck driver after loading is completed. The operator will then enter
    all information related to the transport into EC.</p><p>Note! The well volumes
    entered and calculated within this business function are not used by the production
    allocation. Theoretical volumes used in allocation are found based on the <em>Theoretical
    Calc Method </em>specified in the well configuration. Note that the facility where
    the truck delivers the well fluids should match the operational facility (<em>Op
    Facility Class 1) </em>in the well configuration.</p><p>Some projects only register
    ticket number and not batch numbers. These projects can simply deactivate the
    <em>Batch Number </em>attribute and it will then not show up on the screen.</p><p><u>Prorate
    functionality</u></p><p>In theory, the sum of loaded oil and water volumes should
    match the oil and water volumes unloaded at the receiving facility. In practice,
    these will differ since the loaded quantities and unloaded quantities are measured
    with different measurement devices with various accuracy. The receiving meter
    is assumed to have higher accuracy compared to the field measurements taken at
    the wells during truck loading. The business function, therefore, includes an
    automatic calculation of prorated well gross oil, net oil and water volumes.</p><p>Well
    gross and net oil volumes will be prorated to match the corresponding gross and
    net volumes on the receiving stream as illustrated below:</p><p>Well<span style="font-size:
    10pt;"> water volumes will be prorated to match the receipt stream water volume
    + free water volume (drained off the truck).</span></p><p><span style="font-size:
    10pt;">Both the original and prorated well volumes are maintained within the system
    and are visible </span>on<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the screen.</span></p>'
