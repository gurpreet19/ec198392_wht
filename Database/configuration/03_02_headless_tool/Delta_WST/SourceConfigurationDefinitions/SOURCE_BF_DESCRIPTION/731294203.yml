  DESCRIPTION: '<p><strong>Forecast Quantities By Field screen</strong> is used to
    manage the Quantity Forecast Cases in terms of quantities. In addition, this BF
    manages comments attached to each Field taking part in a Quantity Forecast Case.&nbsp;</p><p>The
    Quantity Forecast Case quantities can either be manually entered into the Quantity
    Forecast Case using this BF or uploaded through a flat file interface. Upload
    of Quantity Forecast Case quantities can be done using a scheduler job designed
    for this. A typical scenario is to start by uploading or entering the quantities
    for a Quantity Forecast Case having POPULATE_METHOD set to ''PLAN''. The next
    step is to make copy of this Quantity Forecast Case and change the POPULATE_METHOD
    to ''YEAR_TO_MONTH'' to create a Closing Forecast (CF) for January. The MONTH
    attribute for the January CF will then be changed to January and the new Quantity
    Forecast Case can be updated with Final/Accrual quantities from the EC Revenue
    Quantities module for January using the "Populate Forecast Case" function in BF
    (FC.1001) Quantity Forecast Properties. The Closing Forecast for February will
    then be created by making a copy of the January CF and changing the MONTH attribute
    to February.&nbsp;The February CF can then be updated with actual quantities from
    the EC Revenue Quantities module using the "Populate Forecast Case" function.</p><p>The
    BF consists of these screen sections:</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 71, 178);">Static
    Navigator</strong></p><p>The following query elements are available for selecting
    a Quantity Forecast Case and determining which parts of the Quantity Forecast
    Case to view:</p><ul><li>Year: By selecting a Year the Forecast Case popup will
    be limited to only show Quantity Forecast Cases for that year.</li><li>Forecast
    Case: This popup will list all the Quantity Forecast Cases for the selected Year
    available to the current user, i.e. all PUBLIC cases independent from which user
    originally created it, and all PRIVATE cases belonging to the current user.</li><li>Company:
    From this selector the user can select to view COMPANY specific quantity values
    vs. FULL values. By selecting a particular COMPANY the quantity sections in this
    BF will only show Stream Items having the COMPANY attribute set to the selected
    COMPANY. By selecting ''FULL'' the quantity sections in this BF will only show
    Stream Items having the COMPANY attribute set to FULL. This way it is possible
    to either view/modify company specific quantities or full (100%) quantities. The
    popup will only list Companies having the SYSTEM_COMPANY flag set to Yes (Y) in
    addition to the FULL company.</li><li>Field Group: By selecting a Field Group
    only Stream Items having the FIELD attribute set to one of the Fields belonging
    to the selected Field Group will be listed in the Quantity Overview Section. This
    way users having responsibility for a limited number of Fields can view the relevant
    fields.</li><li>The <strong style="color: rgb(0, 138, 0);">GO</strong> button
    will execute the query and view the quantity details for the selected Quantity
    Forecast Case in the following sections.</li></ul><p><strong style="color: rgb(0,
    71, 178);">Quantity Overview Section</strong></p><p>This section lists the Stream
    Items defined for the Quantity Forecast Case filtered by the selection criteria
    set by the Static Navigator. It is a table sorted vertically by Field Name. The
    columns are the Product Objects defined for the Quantity Forecast Case, sorted
    horizontally according to the Product Object Sort order. The Stream Item values
    are each summed across the year, i.e. it is the sum of the monthly numbers for
    each Stream Item. A Subtotal is calculated in the screen adding all the Stream
    Items together per Product Object. The Adjustment Stream Item is NOT part of the
    subtotal. The Adjustment Stream Item is a sum of the Adjustment Stream Item for
    each Field. This value is also calculated in the screen, i.e. the number is NOT
    stored in the database. The Field subtotal and the Adjustment sum is then added
    to get a Quantity Forecast Case Total for each Product Object. The Quantity Forecast
    Case Total is calculated on the fly and NOT stored in the database.</p><p>For
    each row there is also a column for SUM across the Product Objects for each Field
    calculated in BOE. The SUM quantity is also calculated to BOE/Day.</p><p>These
    values are not stored in the database, they are calculated on the fly.</p><p>This
    section has a <strong style="color: rgb(0, 138, 0);">POPULATE FORECAST CASE</strong>
    button for updating Stream Item values with actual data from the EC Revenue Quantities
    module, table STIM_MTH_ACTUAL. This button will also update any of the Adjustment
    Stream Items.</p><p>This section has a button for setting the entire Quantity
    Forecast Case to APPROVED. The <strong style="color: rgb(0, 138, 0);">APPROVE</strong>
    button will only be accessible by users having the access rights set accordingly,
    i.e. access rights to change record status from PROVISIONAL / VERIFIED to APPROVED.</p><p>This
    section also has a button for resetting a Quantity Forecast Case from APPROVED
    back to PROVISIONAL. When performing this action the system must check that if
    the Quantity Forecast Case in question is in use by a Revenue Forecast Case, the
    Revenue Forecast Case MUST NOT have status APPROVED, i.e. it is not allowed to
    reset a Quantity Forecast Case to PROVISIONAL if the corresponding Revenue Forecast
    Case is set to APPROVED. Similarly it will not be allowed to set a Revenue Forecast
    Case to APPROVED unless the corresponding Quantity Forecast Case has been set
    to APPROVED first.</p><p>This section will handle cases where there are no stream
    items for a given combination of Field and Product Object, i.e. a pure Gas Field
    will not have any Crude Stream Items. For these cases the table will simply have
    no quantity for the given Field / Product Object. This section will have NULL-handling
    in order to ensure correct sub-totals, grand totals, sum in BOE, and sum in BOE/day
    in case of <u>missing</u> stream items.</p><p>All values are read only in this
    section, regardless of record status or access privileges.</p><p><strong style="color:
    rgb(0, 71, 178);">Field/Month Quantity Section</strong></p><p>This section lists
    the Stream Items for the Field selected in the Quantity Overview section in combination
    with the other query parameters set in the Static Navigator, i.e. only Stream
    Items matching selected Field in the Quantity Overview section together with the
    Company selection for the selected Quantity Forecast Case. This section will have
    one row for each month of the year.</p><p>Each row will be read only or editable
    depending on the POPULATE_METHOD of the Quantity Forecast Case and the Row Status
    for each row.</p><p>The Row Status is calculated as follows for Quantity Forecast
    Cases having POPULATE_METHOD set to ''YEAR_TO_MONTH'':</p><ul><li>If ALL Stream
    Items for a particular month is set to FINAL, then the Status is set to FINAL
    and the row is read only. A Stream Item will have its Status set when updating
    the Quantity Forecast Case with actual numbers from the Quantity module. The Status
    will then be set to the same value as the Stream Item has in the Actual table
    (STIM_MTH_ACTUAL)</li><li>If ONE of the Stream Items for a particular month is
    set to ACCRUAL, then the Row Status is set to ACCRUAL and the row is read only.
    A Stream Item will have its Status set when updating the Quantity Forecast Case
    with actual numbers from the Quantity module. The Status will then be set to the
    same value as the Stream Item has in the Actual table (STIM_MTH_ACTUAL)</li><li>If
    none of the criteria above is fulfilled, the Row Status is set to PLAN and the
    row is editable given the user has the access rights with respect to modifying
    PROVISIONAL / VERIFIED / APPROVED data elements.</li></ul><p>For Quantity Forecast
    Cases having POPULATE_METHOD set to ''PLAN'' all rows will be editable given the
    user has the access rights with respect to modifying PROVISIONAL / VERIFIED /
    APPROVED data elements</p><p>A Year Total per Product Object for the selected
    Field is calculated by the screen and not stored in the database. The Year Total
    quantity is read only.</p><p>This section also provides a read-only field for
    showing the Adjustment Stream Item quantities. These quantities are entered using
    the VO screens and will be copied to the Quantity Forecast Case as part of the
    "Populate Forecast Case" method in BF (FC.1001) Quantity Forecast Properties.
    These quantities are stored as a monthly number at the first month of the Quantity
    Forecast Case, i.e. January.</p><p>A Grand Total per Product Object for the selected
    Field is calculated by the screen and not stored in the database. The Grand Total
    is the sum of the Year Total and the Adjustment per Product Object.</p><p>For
    each row there is also a column for SUM across the Product Objects for each Month
    calculated in BOE. The SUM quantity is also calculated to BOE/Day according to
    the number of days for each month. The number of days in February will be 29 for
    leap years. These values are not stored in the database, they are calculated on
    the fly.</p><p>The Stream Items connected to a Quantity Forecast Case may not
    be valid for all the months through the year. If this is the case for a Stream
    Item, the data element for the combination of Product Object and Month will be
    NULL and read only.</p><p>When entering or modifying quantities in this section
    the Cascade logic will be executed in order to update any other Stream Items being
    part of the Quantity Forecast Case which has a Formula or Split Key reference
    to the Stream Item in question.</p><p>Stream Items defined for the selected Quantity
    Forecast Case and Field which has no value set, i.e. the Stream Item value is
    NULL, will be marked in red to make it easier to identify missing quantity data.
    To change this, the user can press on the <strong style="color: rgb(0, 138, 0);">POPULATE
    FORECAST CASE</strong> button above to repopulate the stream items with actual
    data from the EC Revenue Quantities module, table STIM_MTH_ACTUAL. Also, this
    section will handle cases where there are no stream items for a given combination
    of Field and Product Object, i.e. a pure Gas Field will not have any Crude Stream
    Items. For these cases the table will simply have no quantity for the given Field
    / Product Object. This section have NULL-handling in order to ensure correct sub-totals,
    grand totals, sum in BOE, and sum in BOE/day in case of <u>missing</u> stream
    item.</p><p>This section has a button for setting the forecast quantities and
    comments for the selected Field to VERIFIED. The <strong style="color: rgb(0,
    138, 0);">VERIFY</strong> button is only be accessible by users having the access
    rights set accordingly, i.e. access rights to change record status from PROVISIONAL
    to VERIFIED.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 71, 178);">Field Comments Section</strong></p><p>This
    section manages one or more Comments for the selected combination of Quantity
    Forecast Case and Field. The user can Add / Delete / Modify Field Comments. Each
    Comment is categorized by setting a category for each Comment. The categories
    will be defined by the customer through EC Codes entries. By default there will
    be two Comment Categories defined: GENERAL and MONTH_SPECIFIC. These can be deleted
    and replaced by customer specific Comment categories by the customer.</p><p>The
    Field Comments can only be modified by users having access rights according to
    the record status of the Comments, i.e. if the Comments have been set to VERIFIED
    only users having access rights to modify VERIFED records can change them. The
    same concept applies to APPROVED records.</p>'
