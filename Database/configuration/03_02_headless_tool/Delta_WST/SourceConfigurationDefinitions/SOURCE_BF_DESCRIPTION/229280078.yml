  DESCRIPTION: <p>This BF handles events on contract accounts. The screen can be used on days where the delivery expectations are not met, to register the claimed quantity together&nbsp;with the type of event that occurred. The registered record will only be used in calculations on the date it is registered. Only Contract Accounts which have defined&nbsp;valid event types may be selected in the navigator.</p><p>The Accepted checkbox should be checked after the event has been reported in to the contract owner or the customers (depending on the account), and has been&nbsp;accepted by them. After it is accepted, the record will not be editable for normal users, only the user with access to verified data can modify the record. If it is&nbsp;unaccepted then the record will be editable again.</p><p>The comments field should be used for explaining why expectations were not met.</p><p>In the Contract Account screen it can be defined which event types that are available for the selected account, what the unit of measure (UOM) is on the quantity,&nbsp;and determine if it is mandatory for that contract account to store the Qty when registering the event.</p>
