  DESCRIPTION: '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">    There are 3 screens under
    CODES section:<br>    - EC Codes-All (BF CO.1011)<br>    - EC Codes - Non-System
    Codes (BF CD.0034)<br>    - EC Codes - System Codes (BF CD.0084)</span></p><p><span
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">    Generally all Codes are shown in EC Codes-All
    screen and all these are    categorized and shown in other screens (Non-System
    or System Codes screens)    based upon the System Code Attribute.<br>    EC Codes
    need to have System Attributes configured for separation into    Non-System /
    System screens.</span></p><p>    <strong>EC Codes - Non-System Codes screen</strong>    is
    used to handle all EC codes that are not System codes, i.e.    IS_SYSTEM_CODE
    = N.</p><p>    Non-System Codes allow customers to change items in some of the
    dropdownsthat the customer can expand with new choices. <br> These are EC Codes    <em>available</em>
    to the end users and can be changed without key    functionality in EC <em>crashing</em>.</p><p>    Typically
    EC Codes - Non-System Codes screen is available to different    users compare
    to the EC Codes - System Codes screen that is only handling    EC codes where
    IS_SYSTEM_CODES = Y.<br>    The System EC codes are normally NOT to be changed
    as this can cause    unpredictable behavior of EC.</p>'
