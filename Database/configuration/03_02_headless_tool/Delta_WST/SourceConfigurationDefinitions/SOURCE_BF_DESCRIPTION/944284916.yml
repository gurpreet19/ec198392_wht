  DESCRIPTION: <p>EC codes are basically categorized string constants.</p><p>There are three EC code screens:</p><ul><li>EC Codes-All (BF CO.1011)</li><li>EC Codes - Non-System Codes (BF CD.0034)</li><li>EC Codes - System Codes (BF CD.0084)</li></ul><p>Generally all EC codes are shown in the EC Codes-All screen, whereas the other two screens show only system or non-system EC codes based on the value of the "System Code" attribute. This is split into multiple screens to allow easy access control for end users.</p><p>The <strong>EC Codes - Non-System Codes</strong> screen is used to handle EC codes that are not system codes, i.e. IS_SYSTEM_CODE = N.</p><p>Non-system codes are meant to be modifiable by customers. It is safe to add, remove or edit these EC codes. One should still be careful when editing or removing EC codes that are in use.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
