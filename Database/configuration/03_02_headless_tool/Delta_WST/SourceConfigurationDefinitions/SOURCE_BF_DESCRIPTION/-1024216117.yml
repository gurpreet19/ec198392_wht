  DESCRIPTION: <p>The Class Attribute Configuration screen provides an interface for editing of class attribute properties.</p><p>The user is not allowed to change the configuration&nbsp;of a class except for new project specific attributes.</p><p>At the top of the screen is a navigator where the user can select an attribute of a class. The navigator consists of a class type popup, a class popup and an attribute popup.</p><p>The class type popup lists all supported class types, e.g. OBJECT,&nbsp;DATA, etc. The class popup lists all classes corresponding to the selected class type.</p><p>At the bottom of the screen is a "Generate All Class Views" button and, after navigating to a specific class attribute, a "Generate Class View" button.<br></p><p>These buttons are used to regenerate all class views or only the class view of the current class. This is typically used when an attribute property&nbsp;is being modified, added or deleted.</p><p>If, for some reason, the regenerating of the view fails, the error message is written to table T_TEMPTEXT with id GENCODEERROR. An error message will be displayed to the user, but note that the view will contain errors and other users can be affected by it.</p><p>If the view generation is ok the changes are available to all users right away.</p>
