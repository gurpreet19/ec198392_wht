  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Revenue Lock Module screen</strong>    is used to lock
    modules for Input actions.</p><p>    This is done to avoid last minute changes
    in a wrong sequence before the    Booking Period Closing. More specifically, all
    VO (Volume) panels and all    panels in the Validation and Process folders in
    IN (Inventory) and SP    (Financial Transactions or Sales and Purchases) will
    be disabled for saving    when the corresponding module is locked.</p><p>    The
    Setup panels in these modules will be available for Input. Users will    be notified
    when a save attempt is done.</p><p>    <strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 153,
    0);">Lock</span> button</strong><br>    A module is locked by marking in it in
    the table and clicking the Lock    button.</p><p>    <strong><span style="color:
    rgb(0, 153, 0);">Unlock</span> button</strong><br>    Unlocking is done by marking
