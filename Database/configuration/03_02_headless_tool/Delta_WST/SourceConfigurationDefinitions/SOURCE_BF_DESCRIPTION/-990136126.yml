  DESCRIPTION: "<p>This business function list the targets for the day and the daily\
    \ flow profile calculated based on the different targets.</p><p>The targets for\
    \ the day are created in Daily Nomination Location Target (SD.0053). All targets\
    \ created for selected day in the navigator is listed in the first section.</p><p>The\
    \ next section list the hourly profile. When a new target is created within the\
    \ day the flow rates already issued as a target up to the hour of issue of the\
    \ new target are retained.</p><p>When the target is initially issued, the prorating\
    \ is quite simple. The daily target is simply profiled over the day in proportion\
    \ to any profile defined for the wet gas. The situation becomes slightly more\
    \ complex when a target has already been issued for the day in which the original\
    \ hourly figures are retained up to the time of the change. The new target value\
    \ is then used to calculate the total for the remaining hours such that the overall\
    \ average for the day now equals the new target. Once the average values have\
    \ been calculated, these values are then profiled according to any profile defined\
    \ for the wet gas in a similar manner to that described above.</p><p>The End of\
    \ Day Target is the current target for the selected hour</p><p>Example when only\
    \ one target:<br>Time 06:00, Target TJ = 2400</p><table style=\"border-collapse:\
