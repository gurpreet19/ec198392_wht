  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The "Maintain User Settings" screen provides an interface for maintaining
    user preferences. The screen provides functionality allowing super users to specify
    preference settings on behalf of other users or roles. This screen should only
    be used by the system administrator.</p><p>The preferences are resolved runtime
    and preference values assigned to users will have higher precedence than those
    assigned to roles. If a key with default value dv have an override value rv for
    role r and another override value uv for user u, the following values will be
    resolved (i.e. used in the application) for user v which are associated with roles
    Rv.</p><p><table><tr><th>Condition</th><th>Resolved value</th><th>Comment</th></tr><tr><td>u=v</td><td>uv</td><td>Logged
    in user is the user for which the override preference setting was specified for.</td></tr><tr><td>u!=v
    && r ? R</td><td>rv</td><td>No preference setting for the logged on user available,
    but member of the role for which the preference value rv was specified.</td></tr><tr><td>u!=v
    && r !? R</td><td>dv</td><td>No preference setting for the logged on user available,
    and the user is not connected to the role for which the preference value was specified,
    using default value.</td></tr></table></p><p>The following table lists the sections
    in the screen.</p><p><table><tr><th>Screen Element</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Navigator</td><td>Select
    preferences based on category.</td></tr><tr><td>Preference Table</td><td>Lists
    all user preferences and their default values according to the category selected
    in the filter.</td></tr><tr><td>Preference Override Table</td><td>List the preference
    value overrides for specific users and roles.</td></tr><tr><td>Preference Detail</td><td>Displays
    the value fields for the selected preference override.</td></tr></table></p><p>The
    insert button is used to create a new record in the Preference Override Table.
    Preference values can then be assigned for the inserted user or role.</p><p>The
    following table describes an insert.</p><p><table><tr><th>User Action</th><th>Screen
    Response</th></tr><tr><td>Click the insert toolbar button</td><td><p>A new empty
    row is inserted in the Preference Override Table with two dropdowns.</p><p>The
    Value column is empty and the Preference Detail section is cleared (no fields
    visible).</p></td></tr><tr><td>Enter type and id, then Save</td><td>The new row
    and the entered user/role are stored. The value field for this row will be blank.</td></tr><tr><td>Enter
    preference values in the Preference Detail section and then Save</td><td>The preference
    values for the given user/role are stored.</td></tr></table></p><p>All the user
    dependent preference values can be updated except for the default value. The default
    value appears in the Preference Override Table with the following owner information:
    type = USER and Id = EC_Default. For this row, the Preference Detail section will
    be protected.</p><p>The following table describes an update.</p><p><table><tr><th>User
    Action</th><th>Screen Response</th></tr><tr><td>Select a preference in the Preference
    Table</td><td>The Preference Override Table is populated with time dependent override
    values for the selected preference.</td></tr><tr><td>If there exists an override
    value for the current user, select the row holding it in the Preference Override
    Table</td><td>The Preference Detail Section is populated with an editable value
    field.</td></tr><tr><td>Update the value in the Preference Detail section and
    then Save</td><td>The preference value for the current user is stored.</td></tr></table></p><p>The
    delete button is used to delete users or roles in the Preference Override Table.
    The preference value will be removed for the given user/role.</p><p>The following
    table describes a delete.</p><p><table><tr><th>User Action</th><th>Screen Response</th></tr><tr><td>Select
    the row in the Preference Override Table</td><td>The row is highlighted. The details
    for the selected row appear in the Preference Detail section.</td></tr><tr><td>Click
    the delete toolbar button</td><td>The Preference Detail section is marked for
    deletion.</td></tr><tr><td>Save</td><td>The selected row is removed from the Preference
    Override Table.</td></tr></table></p><p>The preferences listed for category Group
    Model Type are used to specify the group model type to apply for a given class.
    In the Navigator default value category you will find some preferences labelled;
    ‘Default values in group model for <class name> navigators’. These preferences
    are used to set the default values in the group model navigators for a given class.
    There is a dependency between the preferences used to specify the group model
    type, and those used to specify the group model navigator default values because
    modifying the group model type for a given class will invalidate the corresponding
    default values. The screen is therefore implemented in such a way that updating
    a group model type will result in the corresponding navigator default values being
    cleared for the given user/role. Deleting a group model type value, will result
    in the corresponding navigator default values being removed for the given user/role.</p>'
