  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This Business Function is part of the Business Process to gather and QA monthly NGL stream data. Monthly streams will instantiated the last day of the month.</p>

    <p> The second section lists derived monthly NGL streams. Derived streams are dynamically calculated and are not editable.</p>

    <p>This BF is used when a NGL stream has one monthly reading only. The same stream may also have daily readings, but the daily will then be handled as a separate &lsquo;daily&rsquo; stream.</p>

    <p>Monthly streams can only be included in monthly allocations.</p>
