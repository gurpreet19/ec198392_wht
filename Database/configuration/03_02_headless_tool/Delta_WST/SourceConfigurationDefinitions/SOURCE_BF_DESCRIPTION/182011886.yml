  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Vendor VAT Reg No screen</strong>    is used to manage
    the VAT Registration Numbers for each Vendor. Each VAT    Registration Number
    is linked to a Country.<br>    The system will automatically pick the VAT Registration
    Number for a given    Country if the Destination Country in all the Transactions
    within a    Document is the same Country and there exist a VAT Registration Number
    for    this Country.<br>    If there is no VAT Registration Number for the given
    Country then the    system will pick the VAT Registration Number for the Country
    of the Vendor    object - the default VAT Registration Number.</p><p>    Each
    Vendor may have none, one, or multiple VAT Registration Numbers.</p><p>    <u>Note:</u>    There
    is System Attribute controlling how to deal with VAT Registration    Numbers in
    the Documents: VAT_REG_NO_MANDATORY_IND = Y|N.<br>    - If this attribute is set
    to Y then ALL Vendors should have a VAT    Registration Number defined for the
    Country of the Vendor.<br>    - If this attribute is set to N then one can have
    a mix where some Vendors    have no VAT Registration Number, others have one or
    multiple.</p><p>    The VAT Registration Numbers appear in the Banking Details
    screen under the    Process tree-view entry in the EC application.<br>    The
    Vendor VAT Registration Numbers are stored in the COMPANY_COUNTRY_SETUP    and
    handled by the VENDOR_COUNTRY_SETUP DATA class for the Vendor VAT    Registration
    Numbers.<br>    This table is also used for the Customer VAT Registration Numbers
    but then    through a different class.</p>'
