  DESCRIPTION: "<p><strong>Calendar screen</strong> is used for managing the Calendar\
    \ functionality in EC Revenue, including defining default business days of the\
    \ week and recurring holidays. </p><p> The Calendar BF is also managing the instantiated\
    \ calendar for a given year.</p><p>EC has functionality for automatically determining\
    \ dates for Document Date, Document Received Date, and Payment Date for the Financial\
    \ Documents. In case the determination of such dates involves Business Days vs\
    \ Holidays then EC requires that there is a Calendar for defining each date of\
    \ the year as a Business Day or a Holiday.</p><p>The screen is organized with\
    \ these key components:</p><p> - Navigator </p><p> - List of Calendar objects\
    \ </p><p> - Tabs for Calendar Object / Recurring Holidays / Calendar Setup / Calendar\
