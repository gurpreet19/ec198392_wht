  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <strong>Calendar screen</strong> is used for managing    the

    of the week and recurring holidays.    <br>    The Calendar BF is also managing
    the instantiated calendar for a given    year.</p><p>    EC has functionality
    for automatically determining dates for Document Date,    Document Received Date,
    and Payment Date for the Financial Documents. In    case the determination of
