  DESCRIPTION: '<p>This screen is used to show the actual base plan of schedule lifting
    overview.<p>The navigator consists of From Date, To Date, Facility Class 1, and
    Storage as mandatory fields while Lifting Account popup and Sub Daily data check
    box are both optional.<br>If the Sub Daily Data checkbox is selected, the schedule
    lifting chart and the Berth Utilisation Gantt Chart will display a sub daily schedule
    lifting and gantt chart respectively.<p><b><u>Schedule Lifting Graph</u></b><br>The
    first data section in this screen displays the JSF graphical presentation on the
    storage level over a period. The max level and min level shows the levels of the
    selected storage. The storage level is normally calculated based on the planned/official
    production deducting planned/official nominations. Additional configuration required
    in Maintain User Settings to enable the graph to show all the cargoes on the selected
    date range regardless of the storage selected.<br>There is a "Open Entitlement
    Details" button under the schedule lifting chart section. Clicking this button
    will display the daily entitlements of the selected storage.<p><b><u>Berth Utilisation
    Gantt Chart</u></b><br>The second data section will display a Berth Utilisation
    gantt chart. The berth utilisation gantt chart shows the loading of the berth
    on a particular date range. If lifting account is selected in the navigator, the
    berth will be filtered by the selected lifting account. The tooltip will display
    the status of the berth slots when mouseover on the chart horizontal bars. The
    colour of the chart horizontal bars represent these berth slot status in the product:<ul
    style="list-style-type:disc"><li>Green: Occupied</li> <li>Red: Conflict</li><li>Orange:
    Restrictions</li><p>The colour of the chart is configurable on the EC Code and
    additional statuses, or updates to tooltip of the chart horizontal bars, are configurable
    in an user exit package. The bars can be dragged to adjust the nominated date
    of a cargo nomination. When saved, the adjustment will be reflected in the nomination
    table.<p>If the Sub Daily Data checkbox is selected, the schedule lifting chart
    and the berth utilisation gantt chart will display a sub daily chart respectively.<p><b><u>Nomination</u></b><br>The
    third data section is a nomination table displaying nominations based on the date,
    storage, lifting account selected in the navigator. When the nominated quantity/date
    is updated the associated account transaction is updated, any changes done to
    nominated date and/or nominated quantity will be reflected in the Schedule Lifting
    Chart and Berth Utilisation Chart. It is possible to insert a new nomination in
    the Nomination table.<br>The "View Cargo Details" button under the nomination
    section when clicked will display a popup with more information of the selected
    cargo, and any additional information of the cargo can be added in this popup.
    After updating the cargo information click the "Refresh" button to see the new
    changes reflected on the screen.<p><b><u>Restrictions</u></b><br>The fourth data
    section is the period operational restriction table. It displays the planned maintenance
    for restriction objects such as berth and pipeline. These objects must implement
    the OPERATIONAL_RESTRICTION interface. It is possible to insert a new restriction
