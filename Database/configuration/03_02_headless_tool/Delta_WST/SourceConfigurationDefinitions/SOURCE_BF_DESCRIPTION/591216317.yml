  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used when daily tank data in mass is available. Data can be entered manually or loaded automatically. Energy Components will automatically create a new record for a new production day for all tanks having tank meter frequency = &quot;DAY&quot;. For tanks having tank meter frequency = &quot;EVENT&quot;, there will be no automatic instantiation, the user will have to manually press the insert new record button and select the right tank from the tank drop down. All data is treated as closing tank reading at the end of the production day. Therefore there is no time associated with the reading.</p>

    <p>Opening mass for a day is calculated as last available closing mass, for daily tanks it will always be yesterday closing. If today is the tank&rsquo;s start day there will be no value for yesterday&rsquo;s closing, and opening mass is set to 0</p>
