  DESCRIPTION: <p>The gas demand from industrial and household can vary quite considerable from day to day and from season to season depending on ambient temperature, energy prices, shortfall in other energy sources, etc. Therefore gas is sold on flexible contracts allowing the buyer to vary the quantity to be deliver for a given day - and often also per hour within the day.</p><p>Buyers Nomination is the procedure in which gas buyers inform (&quot;nominate&quot;) the gas supplier of the quantity to be deliver for a given day (and often also per hour within the day). As opposed to the forecast, the nomination is legally binding and once a valid nomination is placed, it also constitutes an obligation to take the nominated amount.</p><p>Buyers will need to nominate for each contract and for each delivery point (if multiple delivery points agreed in contract).</p><p>The nomination procedure is defined in the sales contract and will always state the deadline for when a valid nomination can be made, typically 12-18 hours before the gas-day starts.</p><p>Nominations will typically be constrained by an agreed minimum and maximum daily quantity, often expressed relative to a DCQ (Daily contracted quantity). For example that daily nomination must be within 40-110% of the DCQ. Moreover nominations can be constrained by a defined ramp-up rate, meaning that one need to move gradually rather than making big jumps in nomination quantity. Further there could be constraints on aggregate nominations (from all buyers) to observe capacity / technical constraints by the plant/delivery system. Any such constraints are defined in the gas sales agreement and can differ from contract to contract.</p><p>Several flexible contracts states that if the buyer fails to submit a valid nomination in time, then the supplier shall assume that the last previous valid nomination remains valid, but other contracts allowing for zero nomination could state that no nomination means zero. The proper handling of missing nominations must be contract-dependent and the sale agreement must be carefully examined when configuring the EC application.</p><p>Most gas sales arrangements with flexible off-take also have provisions for renominations, i.e. changes to the nomination after the nomination deadline. Such changes are however normally to be treated on a &quot;best endeavour&quot; basis, meaning that the supplier will undertake to change if it does not impose any operation / commercial problem, normally to be determined on suppliers discretion. Renomination can typically be placed up to maybe 1-2 hours before the actual delivery. If the renomination is accepted, than this will override any previous proper nomination.</p><p>The Daily Nomination business function is a screen where the gas buyer enters/views nomination data. Basic DCQ (Daily Contract Quantity), forecast and nomination information will be listed for selected period, and contracts and delivery points satisfying the navigator selection. When selecting one day, hourly values for this day will be listed, if available.</p><p>Data may be entered either on daily or hourly level, and will also be stored (independently) at both levels. When nominating for a new period, first daily records must be created (&quot;Gen days&quot; button). If hourly nomination is wanted, daily records must also be created (&quot;Gen hours&quot; button). Initially nomination values may be entered either at daily or hourly level. If values are entered at daily level, they will be automatically distributed to hourly level if hourly records are generated (&quot;Gen hours&quot;). Whenever hourly level values are entered, these will override the daily values. As a consequence, daily values will not be editable if values exist on hourly level for the given day. Also, be aware that it is not possible to delete rows in this business function. This to avoid inconsistency vs. calculations performed on these data.</p><p>Data will be stored (independently) at both daily and hourly (if available) level. Data are to be entered in one consistent unit of measure. The unit of measure is defined in the gas sales contract, as an attribute.</p>
