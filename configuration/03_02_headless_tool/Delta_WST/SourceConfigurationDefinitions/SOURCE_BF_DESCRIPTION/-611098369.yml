  DESCRIPTION: "<p>\t<strong>Transaction Values screen</strong>    is used to handle\
    \ the financial values for each Transaction for a Document.The screen will have\
    \ separate sections for handling different types of Line Items.<br>The sections\
    \ will be omitted from the screen if the Transaction has no Line Items of the\
    \ given type.All financial values will be calculated for the different currencies\
    \ defined for the Contract: Pricing Currency, Booking Currency, and Other Currency\
    \ (optional at the Contract).</p><p>    The screen will have all entry fields\
    \ set to protected if the Document Level of the Document is set to VALID1, VALID2,\
    \ TRANSFER, or BOOKED.</p><p>    For OPEN Documents the data entry fields will\
    \ be protected/open as described in the various data sections in this document.</p><p>\t\
    <strong>The screen is divided into these sections:</strong>\t<br>\t<strong>\t\t\
    <em>- Filter Navigator:</em>\t</strong>\t\t<br>    The Filter Navigator lists\
    \ all the contracts being valid at the date selected in the Filter Navigator.\
    \ By clicking a contract object in the Filter    Navigator all the Documents already\
    \ created will be listed in the Document List section.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>-\
    \ Document List:</em>\t</strong>\t\t<br>    The Document List section lists all\
    \ the documents created for the selected contract. By clicking a Document the\
    \ Transaction List will be populated with the    Transactions for the selected\
    \ Document. The first Document will be selected by default.<br>\t<strong>\t\t\
    <em>- Transaction List:</em>\t</strong>\t\t<br>    This section lists the Transactions\
    \ for the selected Document. By clicking a Transaction the Transaction details\
    \ will be listed in the various details    sections, see next bullet points.<br>\t\
    <strong>\t\t<em>- Comments Before:</em>\t</strong>\t\t<br>    This section manages\
    \ comments to appear in front of the Transaction details on the Document Hardcopy.\
    \ When creating the Document / Transaction the system    copies the Transaction\
    \ Comments from the Transaction Template to the Transaction. The user can add,\
    \ delete and modify the comments for each particular    Transaction.</p><h3>\t\
    <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153);\">\t<strong>Quantity Based Line Items</strong>\t\
    </span>\t</h3>\t<p>    This section lists the Quantity Based (LINE_ITEM_BASED_TYPE=QTY)\
    \ Line Items defined for the Transaction. The Line Items shown here will be the\
    \ Price    Elements of the Price Concept selected for the Transaction (defined\
    \ at the Transaction Template). The financial value for each Line Item is calculated\
    \ as    follows: Hydrocarbon Qty * Unit Price * Adjustment Factor = Value.</p><p>\
    \    Neither the Quantity nor the Unit Price can be edited for a Quantity Based\
    \ Line Item using this BF.<br>    - Quantities are handled by Transaction Quantities\
    \ screen (BF SP.0018). Any changes to the UOM1 quantities using BF SP.0018 will\
    \ recalculate the financial    value of the Line Item.<br>    - The Unit Prices\
    \ are handled by Contract Price List screen (BF SP.0011). To update the Line Item\
    \ value after changing the unit prices through BF SP.0011    the user has to run\
    \ the <em>Update Prices</em> function found in this BF. This function will copy\
    \ the updated prices from the Contract and recalculate the    Line Item value.\
    \ A Subtotal is calculated for the section adding all Line Item values together.</p><h3>\t\
    <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153);\">\t<strong>Other Line Item</strong>\t</span>\t\
    </h3><p>    - This section lists Line Items of type FIXED_VALUE, FREE_UNIT, CALC_VALUE\
    \ and CALC_QTY_VALUE. If the Transaction has no such Line Items the section will\
    \    be omitted from the screen.<br>    - The value of the FIXED_VALUE type of\
    \ Line Items will initially be set to the same value as defined in the Line Item\
    \ Template at the Contract / Document    Setup / Transaction Template. The user\
    \ can change the value.<br>    - The Unit Price and Unit of the FREE_UNIT type\
    \ of Line Item will be set to the values defined in the Line Item Template at\
    \ the Contract / Document Setup /    Transaction Template. The user can change\
    \ Unit Price and Unit directly in this BF. By entering the Quantity and/or changing\
    \ the Unit Price the system will    calculate the value as follows: Quantity *\
    \ Unit Price = Value<br>    - When changing Quantity or Unit Price the Line Item\
    \ Value will be calculated directly in the screen without requiring a save operation\
    \ to see the    financial value. The Other Currency value and Booking Currency\
    \ value will be calculated by the save operation. Changing Unit Price or Unit\
    \ will not have    any effect to the setup definitions at the Contract side. A\
    \ Subtotal is calculated for the section adding all Line Item values together.<br>\
    \    - When a save is done in this screen, or if the \"Update Prices\" button\
    \ is pressed, then the calculation engine will be initiated if any line items\
    \ with the    type CALC_VALUE or CALC_QTY_VALUE exists on the current transaction.</p><h3>\t\
    <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153);\">\t<strong>Interest Line Items</strong>\t\
    </span>\t</h3><p>    This section lists any INTEREST type of Line Items. This\
    \ section will handle interest calculation including Compounding.<br>\t<strong>\t\
    \t<em> The following rules apply to the population of Interest Line Item attributes:</em>\t\
    </strong>\t\t<br>    - <strong>\t\t<em>Case 1</em>\t</strong>: Attribute \"interest\
    \ base amount source\" in screen \"Document Setup\" for the current document has\
    \ the value \"CURRENT_DOC\"<br>    Base Amount will be set to the sum of the total\
    \ pricing value on the transaction(s) having a preceding transaction ID and the\
    \ total pricing value on the    transaction(s) having a reversed transaction ID,\
    \ the latter one is most often a negative value. Interest From Date will be set\
    \ to the Due Date on the first    preceding document. Interest To Date will be\
    \ set to Due Date on current document.<br>    - <strong>\t\t<em>Case 2</em>\t\
    </strong>: Attribute \"interest base amount source\" in screen \"Document Setup\"\
    \ for the current document has the value \"MANUAL\": All    values must be entered\
    \ manually.</p><p>    The user needs to enter Interest Rate. Based on the values\
    \ on Base Amount, Interest From Date, Interest To Date and Interest Rate, the\
    \ system will    calculate the Interest value. If the number of interest days\
    \ given by the From Date and To Date exceeds the Compounding Period, the system\
    \ will    automatically add new Line Item records to calculate the interest value\
    \ including compounding.</p><h3>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153);\">\t<strong>Percentage\
    \ Line Items</strong>\t</span></h3>\t\t<p>    This section lists Line Items of\
    \ type PERCENTAGE_ALL, PERCENTAGE_QTY and PERCENTAGE_MANUAL.<br>    - PERCENTAGE_ALL:\
    \ The Base Amount is the sum of the Line Item Values for all other line items\
    \ in the transaction - except percentage type line items<br>    - PERCENTAGE_QTY:\
    \ The Base Amount is the sum of the Line Item Values for the QTY-based line items\
    \ within the transaction.<br>    - PERCENTAGE_MANUAL: The Base Amount will be\
    \ entered manually.</p><p>    When changing any Line Items in the transaction,\
    \ the system will calculated the Percentage Line Item value as follows: Base Amount\
    \ * Percentage Value =    Value</p><p>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- Total Section: </em>\t\
    </strong>\t\t<br>    This section adds all Line Item values giving a Subtotal\
    \ Value. The VAT Value is calculated using the VAT rate based on the Subtotal\
    \ Value. A Transaction    Total Value is calculated by adding the Subtotal Value\
    \ and the VAT Value.<br>\t<strong>\t\t<em>- Comments After:</em>\t</strong>\t\
    <br>This section manages comments to appear in after of the Transaction details\
    \ on the Document Hardcopy. When creating the Document / Transaction the system\
    \    copies the Transaction Comments from the Transaction Template to the Transaction.\
    \ The user can add, delete and modify the comments for each particular    Transaction.</p><h3>\t\
