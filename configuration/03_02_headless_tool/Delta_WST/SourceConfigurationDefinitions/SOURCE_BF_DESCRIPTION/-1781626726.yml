  DESCRIPTION: '<p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 10pt; font-style:
    normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight:
    normal;">The user selects a date, an allocation network, and a job as parameters
    to the allocation process.</p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size:
    10pt; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;
    font-weight: normal;">Daily allocation jobs will be invoked within the selected
    &lsquo;<em>Date&rsquo;</em>. For each day, a new row will be inserted in table
    holding allocation runs. It should be noted that only networks configured with
    one of the daily period codes will be visible in the Allocation Network navigator.
    Similarly, only allocation jobs with period equal day will be visible in the Allocation
    Job navigator.</p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 10pt; font-style:
    normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight:
    normal;">Changing fields in navigator must be populated to the rest of the screen,
    incl. Run Allocation button, by pressing the Go&hellip; button. If changes done
    in navigator without pressing Go&hellip; the user will be notified when pressing
    the Run Allocation button. To run an allocation, all fields of navigator must
    be filled. There are also Logging level-popup to choose log level and Simulate-checkbox.
    Log Level is default to &lsquo;No Details&rsquo;. Simulate-checkbox is checked
    to perform a simulation, and no checkmark results in a normal allocation. The
    allocation is run in the background, it is an asynchronous job, thus it is necessary
    to refresh the screen to see the new run as a row in screen when the allocation
    is finished. Both daily and monthly allocation screens have a list of the running
    allocation jobs.</p><p style=""><font face="Arial, Verdana"><span style="font-size:
    13.3333px;">Confirmation message will be prompted prior to running an allocation
    if the flag is set to true in Maintain System Settiion Screens - Confirmation
    Message.</span></font></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;
    font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps:

    of the log is shown below. The full log can be downloaded in raw format by clicking
    the Download button.</span></p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size:
    10pt; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;
    font-weight: normal;">When a successful monthly run has been approved, it is possible
    to re-run daily allocation on the approved network or any of its sub-network again
    if the system property flag "Allow re-running of Approved calculation" in Maintain
    System Settings is set to "Y". Daily runs can be approved. It is possible to save
    comments on the run, both the successful and the failed runs. It is possible to
    delete a row holding the status of a particular allocation run.</p><p style="font-size:

    Verdana">Upon clicking on this button, a read-only popup window will be opened.
    This popup window will allow users to view the objects (wells/streams/well hookups/facilities)
    that were used in the selected allocation run. When an object is selected the
    users will see the configuration(s) that were valid for the applicable date/period.
    Users will also be able to view Stream Set List and Stream Formula configurations
    for streams.</font></p><p style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 10pt;
