  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>

    <p>The orifice plate is the physical plate (circular plate having an internal opening) located in the meter. AGA 3 specifies various parameters relating to plate dimensions.</p>

    <p>There are several physical orifice plates having identical manufacture data. EC does not keep track of each individual plate, but rather all distinct different types plates. When configuring a new AGA Stream, a reference to an orifice plate must be made.</p>
