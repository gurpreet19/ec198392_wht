  DESCRIPTION: '<p style="font-size: 10pt;">    <em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">        Transactional
    Inventory module in EC Revenue allows complex        inventory valuations using
    the EC calculation engine. It is a standard        calculation where minimal calculation
    knowledge is required and can be        fully configured through creating EC objects
    and configuration. It has        been designed with the intention of creating
    templates with standard        functionality. And for the cases that do not conform
    to the normal        rules, overrides can be created to cater for the exceptions.    </em></p><p
    style="font-size: 10pt;">    <strong>Transactional Inventory Template screen</strong>    is
    used to create and maintain a standard template for Transactional    Inventory.<br>    It
    is recommended to create one Template for each type of Node type in the    system
    (Pipeline, Plant, Storage, and Rail).<br>    <u>Note:</u>    If there are large
    differences in the way inventories flow within one node    type, then multiple
    can be created for each).</p><p>    <strong style="font-size: large;">Navigator</strong></p><p
    style="font-size: 10pt;">    It is used to filter the period (month) the Template
    will be available for.</p><p>    <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Transactional
    Inventory Template List Section</strong></p><p style="font-size: 10pt;">    The
    section lists all the Transactional Inventory Templates for the given    period.</p><p
    style="font-size: 10pt;">    <strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Report
    Reference Filter </span>Button</strong><br>    The button will show the pop-up
    window where the user can map (add or    delete) a Report Reference to the Document
    Template that will allow to pull    in data to view that then can be used in Calculations
    and Reports.<br>    Report references are used to allow flagging items in the
    Transactional    Inventory that will allow it being pulled out in predefined classes.</p><p>    <strong
    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Transactional Inventory Lines Section</strong></p><p
    style="font-size: 10pt;">    The section allows to create, update and view Transactional
    Inventory    Lines.     When there is a Transaction Inventory Template, the Inventory
    Lines can    then be added.<br>    <em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><u>Transactional
    Lines</u>        are used to indicate the activity for the month or subtotal such
    as        available or values that have come in, that should be indicated        separately
    to allow tracking the value (such as extra additions only        that do not include
    the regular usage or transfer in value).    </em></p><p style="font-size: 10pt;">    Each
    Node type can have different lines but required lines are POOL(Available) and
    OVERLIFT (used to store any overlift values.    <u>The most common setup would
    be:</u><br>    <strong><em>- Transferred In (XFER_IN)</em></strong>    - these
    can be connected to transfer out lines on different inventories or    product
    streams. If they are on a different product stream then the stream    must have
    a higher priority in the product stream group, to indicate that    it has been
    processed before it gets to the current product stream,<br>    <strong><em>- Purchases
    (INCREASE)</em></strong>    - this just indicates it is increasing the balance
    of the inventory,<br>    <strong><em>- Gain and Loss (Pre Pool and Post Pool)</em></strong>    -
    this indicates it can increase or decrease the balance. They can come    before
    or after the pool line,<br>    <strong><em>- Available (POOL)</em></strong>    -
    this is the line that indicates the quantities and values available to be    used
    for the Inventory. Usually INCREASE comes before this line and    DECREASE after,
    as DECREASE will use the valuation from the POOL if no    other is given,<br>    <strong><em>-
    Sales (DECREASE)</em></strong>    - this indicates that it decreases the balance
    of the inventory and should    come after the pool line,<br>    <strong><em>-
    Transferred Out (XFER_OUT)</em></strong>    - This is used in combination with
    the XFER_IN Lines,<br>    <strong><em>- Overlift (OVERLIFT)</em></strong>    -
    this functionality is not yet in place,<br>    <strong><em>- Summary Line</em></strong>&nbsp;-
    this allows creating inventories that are for informational purposes that    group
    the inventories together,<br>    <strong><em>- Net Zero Line</em></strong>&nbsp;-
    this is used when the value should not affect the overall balance.</p><p style="font-size:

    style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Button&nbsp;</strong><br>    Button allows to copy
    chosen Transactional Inventory Line to clipboard to    be able to know which to
    paste later. It will not store the settings for    the line but simply what object
    it should copy. It will pull the values at    the time of pasting. The value will
    be stored per user and will be saved    until a new inventory line is copied.</p><p

    allows to find what Transactional Inventory Line was previously    marked for
    copying by the user. It will then create a new Line using the    From Date in
    Navigator. If there is already a Line on the chosen    Transactional Inventory
    for the period it will get the end date one day    before the New Line will start.
    It will set all the attributes in the line    to the same as the copied one. It
    will then go and create new products with    the new date, and all the values
    the same values as the originals.</p><p>        <strong style="font-size: large;">PRODUCTS

    the definition of <strong>Product</strong> is not limited to a        specific
    physical unit but can also refer to costs associated to        products. Diluent
    is considered a product which has a corresponding        value (and a price can
    be generated), but a transportation cost for the        diluent is also considered
    a product of cost type (that is connected to        a physical product) and will
    need to have its own configuration.    </em><br>    <u>        The system will
    automatically generate standard products based on the        Product Group chosen
    on the Product Stream Setup.    </u></p><p style="font-size: 10pt;">    <u>        Products
    only need to be created here if they are exceptions to the        standard configuration.    </u>    One
    examples of this would be if they need to be processed in a different    order,
    as they are pulling values from other products and therefore the    other products
    need to be processed first. A second example would be if the    product should
    pull detail from a line in an extract (and this would be the    same source for
    each of the inventories that use this as a template).</p><p style="font-size:
