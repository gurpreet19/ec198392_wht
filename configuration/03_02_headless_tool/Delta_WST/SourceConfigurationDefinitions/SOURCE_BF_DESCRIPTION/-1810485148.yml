  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>

    <p>An allocation network is a collection of streams and nodes that form a logical model of the infrastructure. Multiple allocation networks may be defined in an EC installation. Althongh the name is Allocation Network, it is actually a Calculaton Network, where other calculations than allocation calculations can be done. Examples are; Production Sharing Agreeement calculcations and Deferment calculations.</p>

    <p>This screen lets the user create a new allocation network. The allocation network is empty at creation. Nodes can be added to the network from the Allocation Network List (CO.0085) screen. Nodes can be explicit nodes (created using Create Node), or implicit nodes (e.g. Facility Class 1 object where Include in Alloc Flag = Y).</p>

    <p>Streams are not explicitly added to an allocation network. Streams will be included in an allocation network if they are associated with a node that belongs to the network. Streams will flow from a node and to a node, and they are used to carry the data from a node to another node. Streams do not have equations, only nodes have equations being executed for incoming and outgoing streams.</p>
