  DESCRIPTION: '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">EC has functionality for automatically
    pick Accounts and    <strong>Cost Objects</strong> for the posting to an ERP system
    of    individual line items in the Financial Documents.<br>    The posting information
    is stored at the lowest level in the Document -    Transaction - Line Item - Line
    Item Profit Centre - Line Item Profit Centre    Company hierarchy.<br>The logic
    is to find first the applicable Account and then the applicable    <strong>Cost
    Object</strong>.</span></p><p>        <strong>Cost Object Mapping screen</strong>    is
    used to define the rules for finding the correct Cost Object - Cost    Centre
    or WBS / AFE - for a Line Item where the Account for the Line Item    has been
    set to use a Cost Object.</p><p>    <u>The concept is to find a best match based
    on a set of criteria:</u><br>    <strong><em>- Cost Object Type</em></strong><br>    Match
    the Cost Object type of the Cost Object Mapping with the Cost Object    Type defined
    for the Account.<br> <strong> <em>- Company</em></strong><br>    Match the Company
    of the Cost Object Mapping with the Company of the Line    Item in question.<br>    Must
    be set.<br> <strong><em>- Profit Centre</em></strong><br>    Match the Profit
    Centre of the Cost Object Mapping with the Profit Centre    of the Line Item in
    question.<br>    Can be left blank to indicate that the Cost Object Mapping is
    applicable to    all Profit Centers.<br>        <strong><em>- Node</em></strong><br>    Match
    the Node of the Cost Object Mapping with the Node of the Line Item in    question.<br>    <u>Note</u>    :
    This is only applicable if the Financial Documents are using the Stream    Item
    variant.<br> <strong><em>- Line Item Type</em></strong><br>    Match the Line
    Item Type of the Cost Object Mapping with the Line Item Type    of the Line Item
    in question.<br>    Can be left blank to indicate that the Cost Object Mapping
    is applicable to    all Line Item Types.<br>        <strong><em>- Product</em></strong><br>    Match
    the Product of the Cost Object Mapping with the Product of the Line    Item in
    question.<br>    Can be left blank to indicate that the Cost Object Mapping is
    applicable to    all Products    </p><p>    The best match Cost Mapping object
    will then give the Cost Object to use    for the posting given by the Cost Object
    attribute of the Cost Object    Mapping.<br>    It will be the Cost Object found
    that will hold the actual Cost Centre or    WBS / AFE to use for the posting.</p><p>    <strong>The
    Alternative Code</strong>    of the Cost Object Mapping is auto-generated by the
    system when saving.<br>    The Alternative Code is a concatenation of the data
    elements: Cost Object    Type, Company Code, Profit Centre Code, Node Code, Line
    Item Type.<br>    Each data element is separated with and underscore.</p><p>    <u>        An
    example: </u> <em>Alternative Code - <strong>C_CA_ECP_US__TRANS_US</strong>    </em><br>    <em>Cost
    Object type - <strong>C</strong> in this example,</em><br>    <em>Company Code
    - <strong>CA_ECP</strong> in this example,</em><br>    <em>Profit Centre Code
    - <strong>US</strong> in this example,</em><br>    <em>Node Code -  <strong> null
    </strong> (blank) in this example,</em><br>    <em>Line Item Type -&nbsp;<strong>TRAN
    </strong> in this example.</em></p><p>        <u>Note:</u>    There is no specific
    logic attached to the Alternative Code - it is there    just to indicate the key
    settings of each Cost Object Mapping.</p>'
