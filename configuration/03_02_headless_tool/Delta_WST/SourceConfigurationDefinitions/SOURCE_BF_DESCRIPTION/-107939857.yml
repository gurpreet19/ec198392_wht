  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>

    <p>External location is used to identify and register official locations for onshore operations that often truck volumes to and from their own facilities/wells. The external locations could spread over large geographical areas and for large operations trucks may truck out/in liquids from/to many thousand different external locations.</p>

    <p>These external locations are then linked to Facility Class 1 level in EC as a many to many relation. E.g. One external location (e.g. a pipeline) can be trucked to from several facilities. To make that connection, use the BF External Location Connection.</p>

    <p>Auto retrieve is purposely turned off for this screen.</p>
