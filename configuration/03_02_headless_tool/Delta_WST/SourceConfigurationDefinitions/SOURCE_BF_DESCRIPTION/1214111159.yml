  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to list well data &ndash; water source wells data for a Period (From &ndash; To Date) and for only one well. The well is directly connected to a facility, without any intermediate flowline / pipeline systems.</p>

    <p>Data can be entered manually or automatically. The BF requires one entry per well per day, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all active water producing wells identified by WELL_TYPE = &lsquo;WS&rsquo; (Water Source). In addition to that, the production well is recognized by having attribute WELL_CLASS set to &lsquo;P&rsquo; (Producer) or &lsquo;PI&rsquo; (Producer and Injector) and Instrumentation Type have any defined value.</p>

    <p>This BF is actually a variant of the WR.0013 &ndash; Daily Well Data &ndash; Water Source Wells, but with a different navigator type to display the records for a well throughout a period. It will have reference to the WR.0013, and the values for both BF should match.</p>
