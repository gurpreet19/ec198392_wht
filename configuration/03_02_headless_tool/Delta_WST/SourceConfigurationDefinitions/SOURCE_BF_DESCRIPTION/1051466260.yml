  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used by the transport service provider to view and manually enter sub daily operational nominations into the system.</p><p>Operational nominations are special nominations that only the transport service operator is allowed to enter into the system. These nominations can, depending on project implementation, adhere to different validation rules than normal nominations. Since operational nominations can only be entered by the transport service operator, they are per definition accepted by the operator. The initial nomination status will therefore always be &quot;Accepted&quot;.</p><p>An example of an operational nomination will be imbalance payback from and to the pipeline. Imbalance nominations are used to adjust the gas flow according to the agreed Operational Balancing Agreement&nbsp;(OBA) between interconnected pipelines and the transport service provider.</p><p>The navigation model uses by default TRAN_ COMMERCIAL, but a different navigational model(TRAN_OPERATIONAL) can be used by sending the navigational model as an argument from the treeview&nbsp;(argument NAV_MODEL). When using a different navigational model it is important to be aware of the owner of the data class and the target must be the same object.</p><p>Mandatory arguments which are needed in the url are only CLASS and SUB_CLASS.</p>
