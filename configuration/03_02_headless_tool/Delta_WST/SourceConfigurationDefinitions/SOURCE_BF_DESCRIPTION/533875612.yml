  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used for matching of aggregated nomination values for a delivery point.</p><p>There are at least two types of matching:<br />Matching of aggregated values<br />Matching of upstream/downstream shipper-pairs.</p><p>The aggregated matching is accomplished by comparing the sum of output nominations at the delivery point with the aggregated value of all downstream shipper&nbsp;nominations. If the nominations are not equal or within a tolerance limit all shippers must be informed about the mismatch. The tolerance limit should be system&nbsp;wide, and spesified in system attributes. For matching of upstream/downstream shipper-pairs, see BF &ndash; Exit Point Matching.</p>
