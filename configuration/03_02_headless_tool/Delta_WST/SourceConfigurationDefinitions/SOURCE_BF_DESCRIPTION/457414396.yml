  DESCRIPTION: <p>Report area can be used to group reports into areas, in addition to functional area. A report definition can be connected to one report area. Reports connected to the report definition will then also be connected to that report area.</p><p>Because this class is an object class, it is possible to use report area to provide additional access rules on reports. This is done by adding object partition on the class. This will only apply when the class is updated to provide access control.</p>
