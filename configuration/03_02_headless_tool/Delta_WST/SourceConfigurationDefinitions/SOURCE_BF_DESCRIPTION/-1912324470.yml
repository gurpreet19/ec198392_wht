  DESCRIPTION: '<p>The Process Action screen is designed for users to define their
    own process actions. Once the process action is defined here, it can be invoked
    in the process by a node of "ECProcessAction" type. The process action is identified
    by the Action Name column, and a process action could be used in different processes
    with proper configuration.</p><p>In the Handlers section users can define which
    action handlers to perform and the execution order when the corresponding process
    action is invoked. An action handler could be a business action or a generic process
    action handler.&nbsp;If the parameter of the action handler is given in the Handler
    Parameter Overwrite section, it will overwrite the parameters given in the process.
    The mapping types of the parameter are categorized into four types described as
    follows:</p><ul><li>Default (no mapping): The action handler parameter is given
    by either the process (first handler) or output from the previous handler (preceding
    handlers).</li><li>From an input parameter: The parameter is mapped to an output
    parameter of the previous action handler.</li><li>From an initial input parameter:
    The parameter is mapped to an initial input parameter given to the node in the
    process.</li><li>Manually input: The parameter value is given by manual input
    from the screen.</li></ul><p>The OPERATIONS tab defines possible UI actions for
    further processing the process action execution result, such as viewing a calculation
    log or downloading a generated report. Now EC supports three kinds of operation:</p><ul><li>Launch
    URL in a popup window</li><li>Launch URL in a new window</li><li>Launch URL in
    current window</li></ul><p>The ATTRIBUTES tab defines meta data to a process action.
    Attribute value is not read by process instance, but can be referenced in ECBPM
    value Expressions. This enables providing process action specific data on EC screens.
    For example, the External Data section on Process Overview screen can be configured
    to display data from a specific EC Class based on Process Action Attribute configuration.&nbsp;</p>'
