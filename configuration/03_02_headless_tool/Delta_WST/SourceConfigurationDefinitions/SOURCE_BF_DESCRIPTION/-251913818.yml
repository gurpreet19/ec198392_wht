  DESCRIPTION: '<p>When gas is delivered, exact delivery quantities under each contract
    are tracked. In addition, events related to the delivery must be tracked. This
    is required to determine if deliveries are in accordance with contract, and to
    capture further information required to produce the basis for invoicing.</p><p>A
    gas delivery event is an event, influencing the gas delivery during a certain
    period. As an example, the delivered gas may for a certain period be of a quality
    lower than agreed in the contract. In such case, a typical event would be: &quot;Off-spec
    Gas&quot;, &quot;Start: 2004-10-10 09:00&quot;, &quot;End: 2004-10-12 07:00&quot;.
    In this example, the contract would typically have an attribute &quot;Off-spec
    Gas price deduction&quot;, stating a lower price for &quot;Off-spec Gas&quot;.
    This information will then be used when calculating contract accounts. In some
    cases it is not feasible to derive the wanted quantity from the event period,
    but rather by inputting an exact quantity caused by the event. In such situations
    the exact quantity caused by the event should be tracked.</p><p>The Gas Delivery
    Events business function is a screen for entering/viewing events related to deliveries
    for a given nomination point. The events will be selected from a pre-defined list.
    A start daytime and end daytime must be entered. For each registered event, an
    optional quantity and comment may be entered.</p><p>This business function is
    similar to the Daily Contract Account Events (SA.0008). However, the Gas Delivery
    Events is intended to handle period based events related to what happened in the
    &quot;physical world&quot;, e.g. a period of off-spec gas delivery. The Daily
    Contract Account Events is intended to handle daily events related to happenings
    in the &quot;commercial world&quot;, e.g. commercial arrangements where the parties
    agree to a certain deal addressing a certain situation.</p>'
