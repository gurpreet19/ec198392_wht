  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to enter and display values for the daily price indices.</p><p>A price index is typically used as input to Price Calculation. When long term contracts (e.g. 20 years) are negotiated they will typically agree on some price indexes&nbsp;to be used in the price calculation for the contract. This is to make sure that over time the prices calculated will change according to changes in the market etc.</p><p>This business function allows the user to select a month and an index from a list of those available. The associated index value may then be entered. Data in this&nbsp;business function will be instantiated, so at the end of a month, new (empty) rows will be created in this business function for each day of the next month. But, it is&nbsp;still possible for the user to create new rows as required (using the button). The data presented in this business function is (up to) 31 rows for the month selected&nbsp;in the navigator. The rows are displayed in chronological order i.e. oldest first.</p>
