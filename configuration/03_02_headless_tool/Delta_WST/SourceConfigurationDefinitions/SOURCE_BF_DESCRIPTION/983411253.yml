  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to enter and display values for the annual rates.</p><p>In EC, rates are financial benchmarks used when producing interest rates around the world. Typical examples can be LIBOR and EURIBOR. A rate can be used as input to Price Calculations or PSA Calculation. When long term contracts are negotiated they will typically agree on some rates to be used in the calculation for the contract or the PSA. This is to make sure that over time the calculated result will vary according to changes in the market.</p><p>This business function allows the user to select from a list of annual rates and then enter the associated rate value. The user must create a new row each year (using the + button).</p><p>In EC, rates are configured using the generic PRICE_INPUT_ITEM tables. This allows projects to create specific Price Input items and corresponding transactional business functions.</p>
