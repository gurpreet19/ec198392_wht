  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This BF is used to list steam stream data for a Period (From &ndash; To Date) and for only one Stream. Data can be entered manually or loaded automatically. The BF requires one entry per stream per day, and Energy Components automatically creates new records for a new production day for all steam streams that are part of a stream set for this screen. Thus, this BF has value instantiation for the Day start where blank line for all measured steam streams will be inserted.</p>

    <p>A separate measurement type for steam volume, STEAM_VOL_CWE, has been introduced. In this context, &ldquo;CWE&rdquo; is short for Cold Water Equivalents and represents the volume of cold water that would condense from any given volume of steam upon cooling.</p>
