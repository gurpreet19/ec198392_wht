  DESCRIPTION: <p>The purpose of the Export to Excel Express screen is to provide a simpler version of data extraction functionality. The screen consists of four sections where users configure selected columns, a where condition and sort order to be included in the query. A user can create and store multiple queries and decide if they should be global or private. A global query is visible for all users. A query can only be modified by the creator/owner. The result of the query is exported into an Excel file upon clicking the Export button.</p><p>The "Where Condition" data section allows users to insert and select any column name which has been populated from the selected view in the navigator.</p><p>Comparison can be done with STRING, NUMBER, DATE or COLUMN for the selected column name using operators defined in the operator dropdown.</p><p>The "Order By" data section provides sorting functionality for the query.</p><p>The "Select Export Columns" data section allows user to include the selected columns to be generated in the Excel sheet. Conversion of units is configured in the "From Unit" and "To Unit" dropdowns to convert data into preferred measurements. The "Truncate Date To" dropdown provides the feature to convert dates into preferred format. There is also Aggregation functionality which supports SUM, AVG, MIN &amp; MAX to be included in the query.</p>
