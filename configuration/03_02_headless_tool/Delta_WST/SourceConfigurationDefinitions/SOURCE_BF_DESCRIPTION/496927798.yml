  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to enter and display values for sub daily price indices.</p><p>A price index is typically used as input to Price Calculation. When long term contracts (e.g. 20 years) are negotiated they will typically agree on some price indexes&nbsp;to be used in the price calculation for the contract. This is to make sure that over time the prices calculated will change according to changes in the market etc.</p><p>By selection an object in the navigator all sub daily price indices will be listed. It is optional to select Source and Product, but it can be used to narrow down the result&nbsp;if the navigation is stopped at a higher level in the navigation model.</p>
