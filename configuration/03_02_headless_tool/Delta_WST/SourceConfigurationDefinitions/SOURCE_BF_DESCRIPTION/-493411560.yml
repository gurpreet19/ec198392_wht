    Navigator<br>Lists all Quantity Forecast Cases having attribute YEAR set to the
    same year as the month defined by the Month column in the Filter Navigator. Lists
    all PUBLIC Quantity Forecast Cases, but also any PRIVATE Quantity Forecast Cases
    which belong to the current user.</p><p>?&nbsp;Product Object Section<br>This
    section defines the Product Objects being part of the Quantity Forecast Case.

    Heading to use for each of the Product Objects being part of the Quantity Forecast
    Case.<br>o&nbsp;Product Code: The code of the product associated with the Product

    Stream Items Section<br>This section manages the Stream Items connected to the
    Quantity Forecast Case for each Product Object. The user can add/delete Stream
    Items. When adding a new Stream Item the Stream Item Code popup will list all
    Stream Items matching the Product Code defined for the selected Product Object.
    The user can delete existing Stream Items from the list. The user can add new
    Stream Items to the list. Each Stream Item can only be listed once. A Stream Item
    can not belong both to the Quantity Forecast Case Stream Items list and the Quantity
    Forecast Case Adjustment Stream Items list at the same time.</p><p>?&nbsp;Quantity
    Forecast Case Adjustment Stream Items Section<br>This section manages one or more
    Adjustment Stream Items for the Quantity Forecast Case. When populating a Quantity
    Forecast Case the Adjustment Stream Items will have only one value per year, not
    one for each month as for the Quantity Forecast Case Stream Items. The user can
    delete existing Stream Items from the list. The user can add new Stream Items
    to the list. Each Stream Item can only be listed once. A Stream Item can not belong
    both to the Quantity Forecast Case Stream Items list and the Quantity Forecast
    Case Adjustment Stream Items list at the same time. Typically there will be one
    Stream Item per Product per Field.<br>This section is further separated into 2
    sections, namely &quot;Prior Year Company Adjustment Stream Item&quot; and &quot;Prior
    Year FULL Adjustment Stream Item&quot;.&nbsp; The first one is to hold the yearly
    adjustment stream item for company, and the later to hold the yearly adjustment
    stream item for all companies.</p><p>?&nbsp;Populate Forecast Case Section<br>This
    section contains ?Populate Forecast Case? button that will update Stream Item
    values for the selected Quantity Forecast Case with actual data from the EC Revenue
    Quantities module, table STIM_MTH_ACTUAL. This function will also update any of
    the Adjustment Stream Items.<br></p>'
