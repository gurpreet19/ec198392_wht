  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business Function, Daily AFS (Available for Sale), display actuals and quantities that is available for sale at specific supply points and for specific companies at those supply points.</p><p>The first data section will display Actuals and AFS quantities at each supply point. These actual numbers are retrieved from EC production and the AFS numbers are calculated and can be adjusted in this screen. It is up to the implementation project to create calculations or triggers to keep the two data sections synchronized.</p><p>The second data section will display Actuals and AFS quantities for each company at a supply point. The actual quantities are retrieved from EC production and the AFS numbers are calculated and can be adjusted in this screen. The companies will represent the different producers that are related to a supply point.</p><p>Typically an AFS calculation will run to populate the AFS quantities that are available for sale for the following month for each producer (company) associated with a supply point. This is done based on next month?s equity shares. The users can then update these values on a daily basis to adjust for any operational constraints that might occur.</p><p>In EC, the Supply Point Interface is implemented by the well and stream objects and serves as an interface between EC Production and EC Transport in this domain.</p>
