  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This is a generic screen; see description of generic screens in the beginning of the configuration manual.</p>
    <p>Operator Route is part of the collection point group model. Operator Route is parent to Collection Point. This group model is typically used for big onshore operations where operators have a route to drive to collect data for a set of wells. Operator may not necessarily know which facility the wells belongs to, they just have a route.</p>
    <p>Above Operator Route in the collection point tree, we can typically find area or production unit. Below Operator Route are collection points connected in the group model.</p>
