  DESCRIPTION: <p>This business function is used to maintain monthly rate values that are split into different dimensions.</p><p>The implementation of this business function is done in a generic manner. That means that it can be used to show many different rate dimensions. The product comes with a set of predefined treeview entries, but the project can add more as needed.</p><p>The navigator lets the user select a rate by using the navigation mode. Further the user can select a data set and price object. They are all optional. Some of these may not be applicable for the specific class and will therefore give the user no records in return if used.</p><p>In EC, rates are configured using the generic PRICE_INPUT_ITEM tables. This allows projects to create specific Price Input items and corresponding transactional business functions.</p>
