  DESCRIPTION: "<p>\t<strong>Document Transfer screen</strong>  handles the Document\
    \ Level change from VALID2 to TRANSFER or to OPEN.  <span style=\"font-size: 13.33px;\"\
    >The Static Navigator selection determines which documents to list in the screen.\
    \ If the Document Level selector has been set to VALID2 the system will list documents\
    \ at this level and the user can change Document Level for a document by <br>\
    \  ticking the appropriate level tick box followed by a Save operation. More than\
    \ one document can be ticked before saving.</span></p>   It is divided into three\
    \ sections:<p></p><dir><li><strong>Static Navigator</strong> : Defines the search\
    \ criteria for the Document List.</li> <li><strong>Document List</strong> :Lists\
    \ all the documents found matching the Static Navigator criteria.</li> <li><strong>Document\
    \ Details</strong> : Lists details for the document selected in the Document List\
    \ section.</li></dir><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">  The </span><strong style=\"\
    font-size: 10pt;\"> Toggle tick boxes</strong>\t<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"\
    > button toggles all the \"Set to TRANSFER\" tick boxes. This screen will by default\
    \ have Document Level set to VALID2 in    the Static Navigator.</span><p></p><p>\
    \     - When setting the Document Level selector in the Static Navigator to any\
    \ other value than VALID2 the user can view documents having other Document Levels.In\
    \ this case it is not possible to change level for any document.</p><p>    - When\
    \ the document have changed it status to TRANSFER, the system will ask whether\
    \ to create an interface file to the ERP system right away or leave it to be run\
    \ as a batch job.A scheduler job will be executed to create the interface file\
    \ (depends on the customer requirement) and will update the <br>      CONT_DOCUMENT.FIN_INTERFACE_IND.\
    \ Without the updated indicator, the system will not allow the users to change\
    \ the document level to BOOKED.</p><p>    In the <strong>report selector</strong>\
    \ the user can select one of the configured reports for the selected document\
    \ and preview it.</p><p>\t\t<strong>Validations screen enables user to change\
    \ Document Level for a document.</strong>\t\t<br>    The Document Level follows\
    \ a level hierarchy as follows: OPEN - VALID 1 - VALID 2 - TRANSFER - BOOKED.\
    \ <br>    There are separate validation screens to handle the following Document\
    \ Level changes:<dir>\t\t<li>Document VALID2: Change level from VALID1 to VALID2\
    \ or from VALID1 to OPEN</li><li>Document TRANSFER: Change level from VALID2 to\
    \ TRANSFER or from VALID2 to OPEN</li> <li>Document UN-TRANSFER: Change level\
    \ from TRANSFER to OPEN</li> <li>Document BOOKED: Change level from TRANSFER to\
    \ BOOKED</li></dir><p></p><p>    All SP screens are used for four different purposes\
    \ based on Financial Code:<dir><li><strong>Sales:</strong> This is sales of different\
    \ hydrocarbons.</li> <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> This is purchases of different\
    \ hydrocarbons.</li> <li><strong>Tariff Income:</strong>  This is revenues/sales\
