  DESCRIPTION: '<p>    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><em>        Transactional
    Inventory module in EC Revenue allows complex        inventory valuations using
    the EC calculation engine. It is a standard        calculation where minimal calculation
    knowledge is required and can be        fully configured through creating EC objects
    and configuration. It has        been designed with the intention of creating
    templates with standard        functionality. And for the cases that do not conform
    to the normal        rules, overrides can be created to cater for the exceptions.    </em></span></p><p>    <strong>Transactional
    Inventory Layout Set Setup screen</strong>    allows adding a template to a Transactional
    Layout Set screen (BF IN.0033)    that can be available when viewing an inventory
    in the Transactional    Inventory Overview screen (BF IN.0024).</p><p>    By choosing
    a different template the lower section of the screen will be    updated showing
    different columns dependent on the Template Setup done at    Transactional Inventory
    Layout screen (BF IN.0022).</p><p>    This set can be chosen for the Inventory
    and Product Stream in the    Transactional Inventory Setup screen (BF IN.0036).</p>'
