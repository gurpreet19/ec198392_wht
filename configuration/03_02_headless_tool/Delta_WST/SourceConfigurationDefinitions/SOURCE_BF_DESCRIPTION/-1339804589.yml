  DESCRIPTION: |
    <p>This screen is used to specify monthly Weight and Volume stream % splits per profit centre and component. The split should sum up to 100% for each component. The <em>Component </em>dropdown in the navigator is not mandatory. The screen consists of two sections.</p>

    <p>The upper section shows actual splits based on the navigator choices. The lower section shows the sum per component and is used to verify that the sum of entered splits should sums up to 100%.</p>

    <p>All streams that should be available in this screen must be added to the stream set PO.0075 with label &lsquo;Monthly Stream Component Split by Profit Centre&rsquo;. This screen relies on instantiation. Typically this screen will be used in combination with screen <em>CO.0155 Stream Profit Centre Connection </em>that is used to define profit centre being relevant for the various streams showing up in this Business Function.</p>
